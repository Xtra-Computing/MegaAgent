# Gobang Game Architecture Design

## Overview
This document outlines the high-level architecture for the console-based Gobang (Five in a Row) game with a strong AI opponent. The design ensures modularity, testability, and clear separation of concerns, as per the requirements.

## Module Structure

### 1. main.py (Entry Point)
- Orchestrates the game loop and user interaction.
- Handles game start, restart, and exit options.
- Delegates game logic and AI decisions to respective modules.

### 2. game_logic.py
- Manages the Gobang board state (15x15 grid).
- Handles move validation, placement, and turn management.
- Implements win detection (row, column, diagonal).
- Provides methods for resetting and querying the board.
- Exposes an interface for integration with main.py and AI.

### 3. ai.py
- Implements the AI opponent using advanced algorithms (e.g., Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning, MCTS).
- Supports at least two difficulty levels (configurable).
- Ensures move computation within 2 seconds.
- Receives current board state and returns the AI's move.

### 4. integration.py
- Provides glue code for communication between main.py, game_logic.py, and ai.py.
- Handles input validation and error handling for user moves.
- Manages game state transitions (e.g., restart, exit).

### 5. utils.py (Optional)
- Contains shared utility functions (e.g., board display, input parsing).

### 6. tests/
- Contains unit tests for game logic and AI modules.

## Data Flow & Integration Points
- **main.py** receives user input and delegates to **integration.py**.
- **integration.py** validates input, updates the board via **game_logic.py**, and queries **ai.py** for AI moves.
- **game_logic.py** maintains the board state and checks for win conditions after each move.
- **ai.py** receives the current board state and returns the next move for the AI.
- **main.py** manages the overall game loop, restart, and exit logic.

## Responsibilities
- **main.py**: User interaction, game loop, high-level control.
- **game_logic.py**: Board management, move validation, win detection.
- **ai.py**: AI move computation, difficulty management.
- **integration.py**: Input validation, error handling, module coordination.
- **utils.py**: Shared helpers (if needed).
- **tests/**: Unit tests for core modules.

## Extensibility & Testing
- Each module is designed for independent unit testing.
- The architecture supports easy addition of new features (e.g., more AI levels, different board sizes).

## File Structure
- main.py
- game_logic.py
- ai.py
- integration.py
- utils.py (optional)
- tests/
- requirements.txt
- architecture.txt

---
This architecture ensures a clean separation of concerns, maintainability, and strong support for future enhancements and testing.
