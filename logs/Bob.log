Launch main.py and verify CLI prompts for difficulty and player stone selection.\n2. Play several moves as Player X against AI (easy and hard modes).\n3. Observe AI move validity and responsiveness.\n4. Test quitting the game with 'q'.\n5. Check for any crashes, unhandled exceptions, or logic errors.\n6. Test win/draw detection and edge cases.\n7. Test robustness against invalid input and full board scenarios.\n8. Test 'hard' AI's ability to block four-in-a-row threats with concrete board scenarios.\n\nTest Results:\n-------------\n- CLI prompts for difficulty and player stone selection are clear and function as expected.\n- Board is displayed correctly after each move.\n- User move input is validated; invalid moves are rejected with appropriate messages.\n- AI responds with valid moves and does not crash, even on 'hard' mode.\n- AI moves are legal and placed on empty cells.\n- Game can be exited gracefully with 'q'.\n- No crashes or unhandled exceptions encountered during basic play.\n- Win detection works: Player X was able to win with a horizontal five-in-a-row, and the game announced the win and ended as expected.\n- 'Hard' AI mode (after latest update) now blocks four-in-a-row threats in the following tested scenario:\n\n  Example Scenario (Vertical Threat):\n  -----------------------------------\n  Player (X) moves: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)\n  AI (O) moves: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)\n  At this point, AI blocks (4,0) on its next move, preventing the player from winning.\n\n- AI also blocks horizontal and diagonal four-in-a-row threats in similar test cases.\n- No issues with board boundaries or move validation in tested scenarios.\n- Draw detection and full board scenario tested: (PARTIALLY PASSED)\n  - Simulated filling the top row and part of the board. The game continues until a win or the board is full. However, a draw scenario was not reached in this test due to an AI win. Further targeted draw scenario testing is recommended.\n- Invalid input and edge cases tested:\n  - Out-of-bounds moves (e.g., -1 0, 0 15) are rejected with appropriate messages.\n  - Non-integer input (e.g., 'a b') is rejected with a clear error message.\n  - Attempting to move on an occupied cell is rejected.\n  - Quitting with 'q' works as expected.\n  - No crashes or unhandled exceptions observed during invalid input tests.\n\nAdditional Test: Horizontal Threat Blocking (Passed)\n----------------------------------------------------\nMove sequence:\nPlayer (X): (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)\nAI (O): (1,2), (2,4), (3,4), (2,5), (0,3), (0,7)\nResult: AI correctly blocks the horizontal four-in-a-row at (0,3) and (0,7), preventing a win by X.\n\nIssues/Feedback:\n----------------\n- 'Hard' AI now blocks immediate four-in-a-row threats as expected in all tested cases. (RESOLVED)\n- Draw detection and full board scenario tested, but a true draw was not reached in this session. Recommend further targeted draw scenario testing. (PARTIAL)\n- Invalid input and edge cases tested and handled correctly. (RESOLVED)\n\nNext Steps:\n-----------\n- Notify Bob, Frank, and Dave that all tests are complete except for a true draw scenario, which is recommended for further targeted testing.\n\nConclusion:\n-----------\nInitial integration, basic play, win detection, invalid input handling, and 'hard' AI threat blocking are working as intended. Draw logic is partially tested; further targeted draw scenario testing is recommended. All other edge cases and invalid input handling are confirmed working.\n\n---base_commit_hash---\n4409f5ace857777918fc3b530419c70578802e8b"}

Launch main.py and verify CLI prompts for difficulty and player stone selection.\n2. Play several moves as Player X against AI (easy and hard modes).\n3. Observe AI move validity and responsiveness.\n4. Test quitting the game with 'q'.\n5. Check for any crashes, unhandled exceptions, or logic errors.\n6. Test win/draw detection and edge cases.\n7. Test robustness against invalid input and full board scenarios.\n8. Test 'hard' AI's ability to block four-in-a-row threats with concrete board scenarios.\n\nTest Results:\n-------------\n- CLI prompts for difficulty and player stone selection are clear and function as expected.\n- Board is displayed correctly after each move.\n- User move input is validated; invalid moves are rejected with appropriate messages.\n- AI responds with valid moves and does not crash, even on 'hard' mode.\n- AI moves are legal and placed on empty cells.\n- Game can be exited gracefully with 'q'.\n- No crashes or unhandled exceptions encountered during basic play.\n- Win detection works: Player X was able to win with a horizontal five-in-a-row, and the game announced the win and ended as expected.\n- 'Hard' AI mode (after latest update) now blocks four-in-a-row threats in the following tested scenario:\n\n  Example Scenario (Vertical Threat):\n  -----------------------------------\n  Player (X) moves: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)\n  AI (O) moves: (0,1), (1,1), (2,1)\n  At this point, AI blocks (4,0) on its next move, preventing the player from winning.\n\n- AI also blocks horizontal and diagonal four-in-a-row threats in similar test cases.\n- No issues with board boundaries or move validation in tested scenarios.\n- Draw detection and full board scenario tested: (PARTIALLY PASSED)\n  - Simulated filling the top row and part of the board. The game continues until a win or the board is full. However, a draw scenario was not reached in this test due to an AI win. Further targeted draw scenario testing is recommended.\n- Invalid input and edge cases tested:\n  - Out-of-bounds moves (e.g., -1 0, 0 15) are rejected with appropriate messages.\n  - Non-integer input (e.g., 'a b') is rejected with a clear error message.\n  - Attempting to move on an occupied cell is rejected.\n  - Quitting with 'q' works as expected.\n  - No crashes or unhandled exceptions observed during invalid input tests.\n\nAdditional Test: Horizontal Threat Blocking (Passed)\n----------------------------------------------------\nMove sequence:\nPlayer (X): (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)\nAI (O): (1,2), (2,4), (3,4), (2,5), (0,3), (0,7)\nResult: AI correctly blocks the horizontal four-in-a-row at (0,3) and (0,7), preventing a win by X.\n\nIssues/Feedback:\n----------------\n- 'Hard' AI now blocks immediate four-in-a-row threats as expected in all tested cases. (RESOLVED)\n- Draw detection and full board scenario tested, but a true draw was not reached in this session. Recommend further targeted draw scenario testing. (PARTIAL)\n- Invalid input and edge cases tested and handled correctly. (RESOLVED)\n\nNext Steps:\n-----------\n- Notify Bob, Frank, and Dave that all tests are complete except for a true draw scenario, which is recommended for further targeted testing.\n\nConclusion:\n-----------\nInitial integration, basic play, win detection, invalid input handling, and 'hard' AI threat blocking are working as intended. Draw logic is partially tested; further targeted draw scenario testing is recommended. All other edge cases and invalid input handling are confirmed working.\n\n---base_commit_hash---\n912d21d62c5f32d0b8314cfb23bdd89bb3ebfefa"}
