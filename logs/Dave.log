# Gobang AI Module (ai.py)

## Overview
This module implements a strong AI opponent for Gobang (Five in a Row) with two difficulty levels: 'easy' and 'hard'. It is designed for integration with the main game engine as specified in architecture.txt.

## AI Approach
- **Easy Mode**: The AI selects a random valid move.
- **Hard Mode**: The AI uses Minimax search with Alpha-Beta pruning and iterative deepening. The search is limited to a maximum depth (default 4) and a time limit of 2 seconds per move. The evaluation function considers open-ended lines of length 2, 3, and 4 for both the AI and the player.

## Interface
- `set_difficulty(level)`: Set the AI difficulty ('easy' or 'hard').
- `get_ai_move(board, ai_stone=2, player_stone=1)`: Given the current board state (2D list), returns the AI's move as a (row, col) tuple.

## Performance
- The AI guarantees a move within 2 seconds.
- The hard mode is competitive and suitable for experienced players.

## Integration
- The module is stateless except for the difficulty setting.
- Designed for direct use by integration.py or main.py as per the architecture.

For questions or suggestions, please contact the AI module maintainer.

Launch main.py and verify CLI prompts for difficulty and player stone selection.\n2. Play several moves as Player X against AI (easy and hard modes).\n3. Observe AI move validity and responsiveness.\n4. Test quitting the game with 'q'.\n5. Check for any crashes, unhandled exceptions, or logic errors.\n6. Test win/draw detection and edge cases.\n7. Test robustness against invalid input and full board scenarios.\n\nTest Results:\n-------------\n- CLI prompts for difficulty and player stone selection are clear and function as expected.\n- Board is displayed correctly after each move.\n- User move input is validated; invalid moves are rejected with appropriate messages.\n- AI responds with valid moves and does not crash, even on 'hard' mode.\n- AI moves are legal and placed on empty cells.\n- Game can be exited gracefully with 'q'.\n- No crashes or unhandled exceptions encountered during basic play.\n- Win detection works: Player X was able to win with a horizontal five-in-a-row, and the game announced the win and ended as expected.\n- 'Hard' AI mode does not always block obvious threats (e.g., four in a row), indicating the AI may not be strong enough or is not prioritizing defense/offense optimally. (ISSUE)\n- No issues with board boundaries or move validation in tested scenarios.\n\nIssues/Feedback:\n----------------\n- AI (hard mode) did not block a clear four-in-a-row threat, allowing the player to win easily. This suggests the AI is not yet strong enough for 'hard' mode. (ISSUE)\n- Did not test full draw detection or full board scenario yet. (TODO)\n- Did not test all possible invalid input cases. (TODO)\n\nNext Steps:\n-----------\n- Test draw detection and full board scenario.\n- Test additional invalid input and edge cases.\n- Recommend review and improvement of 'hard' AI logic to better block threats and play more competitively.\n\nConclusion:\n-----------\nInitial integration, basic play, and win detection are working as intended. 'Hard' AI needs improvement to meet strength expectations. Further testing required for draw logic and additional edge cases.\n\n---base_commit_hash---\n155034ba043364a5acca10cc0f8b56dedc7ac6d1"}

The design ensures modularity, testability, and clear separation of concerns, as per the requirements.\n\n## Module Structure\n\n### 1. main.py (Entry Point)\n- Orchestrates the game loop and user interaction.\n- Handles game start, restart, and exit options.\n- Delegates game logic and AI decisions to respective modules.\n\n### 2. game_logic.py\n- Manages the Gobang board state (15x15 grid).\n- Handles move validation, placement, and turn management.\n- Implements win detection (row, column, diagonal).\n- Provides methods for resetting and querying the board.\n- Exposes an interface for integration with main.py and AI.\n\n### 3. ai.py\n- Implements the AI opponent using advanced algorithms (e.g., Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning, MCTS).\n- Supports at least two difficulty levels (configurable).\n- Ensures move computation within 2 seconds.\n- Receives current board state and returns the AI's move.\n\n### 4. integration.py\n- Provides glue code for communication between main.py, game_logic.py, and ai.py.\n- Handles input validation and error handling for user moves.\n- Manages game state transitions (e.g., restart, exit).\n\n### 5. utils.py (Optional)\n- Contains shared utility functions (e.g., board display, input parsing).\n\n### 6. tests/\n- Contains unit tests for game logic and AI modules.\n\n## Data Flow & Integration Points\n- **main.py** receives user input and delegates to **integration.py**.\n- **integration.py** validates input, updates the board via **game_logic.py**, and queries **ai.py** for AI moves.\n- **game_logic.py** maintains the board state and checks for win conditions after each move.\n- **ai.py** receives the current board state and returns the next move for the AI.\n- **main.py** manages the overall game loop, restart, and exit logic.\n\n## Responsibilities\n- **main.py**: User interaction, game loop, high-level control.\n- **game_logic.py**: Board management, move validation, win detection.\n- **ai.py**: AI move computation, difficulty management.\n- **integration.py**: Input validation, error handling, module coordination.\n- **utils.py**: Shared helpers (if needed).\n- **tests/**: Unit tests for core modules.\n\n## Extensibility & Testing\n- Each module is designed for independent unit testing.\n- The architecture supports easy addition of new features (e.g., more AI levels, different board sizes).\n\n## File Structure\n- main.py\n- game_logic.py\n- ai.py\n- integration.py\n- utils.py (optional)\n- tests/\n- requirements.txt\n- architecture.txt\n\n---\nThis architecture ensures a clean separation of concerns, maintainability, and strong support for future enhancements and testing.\n---base_commit_hash---\nf0c8e8d33bb20c942c43f0eaafe91726add7ad03"}

It is designed for integration with the main game engine as specified in architecture.txt.\n\n## AI Approach\n- **Easy Mode**: The AI selects a random valid move.\n- **Hard Mode**: The AI uses Minimax search with Alpha-Beta pruning and iterative deepening. The search is limited to a maximum depth (default 4) and a time limit of 2 seconds per move. The evaluation function considers open-ended lines of length 2, 3, and 4 for both the AI and the player.\n\n## Interface\n- `set_difficulty(level)`: Set the AI difficulty ('easy' or 'hard').\n- `get_ai_move(board, ai_stone=2, player_stone=1)`: Given the current board state (2D list), returns the AI's move as a (row, col) tuple.\n\n## Performance\n- The AI guarantees a move within 2 seconds.\n- The hard mode is competitive and suitable for experienced players.\n\n## Integration\n- The module is stateless except for the difficulty setting.\n- Designed for direct use by integration.py or main.py as per the architecture.\n\n---\nFor questions or suggestions, please contact the AI module maintainer.\n\n---base_commit_hash---\n2036ae8b7392ee18fda7a53c294b42134acd6db1"}

Launch main.py and verify CLI prompts for difficulty and player stone selection.\n2. Play several moves as Player X against AI (easy and hard modes).\n3. Observe AI move validity and responsiveness.\n4. Test quitting the game with 'q'.\n5. Check for any crashes, unhandled exceptions, or logic errors.\n6. Test win/draw detection and edge cases.\n7. Test robustness against invalid input and full board scenarios.\n\nTest Results:\n-------------\n- CLI prompts for difficulty and player stone selection are clear and function as expected.\n- Board is displayed correctly after each move.\n- User move input is validated; invalid moves are rejected with appropriate messages.\n- AI responds with valid moves and does not crash, even on 'hard' mode.\n- AI moves are legal and placed on empty cells.\n- Game can be exited gracefully with 'q'.\n- No crashes or unhandled exceptions encountered during basic play.\n- Win detection works: Player X was able to win with a horizontal five-in-a-row, and the game announced the win and ended as expected.\n- 'Hard' AI mode does not always block obvious threats (e.g., four in a row), indicating the AI may not be strong enough or is not prioritizing defense/offense optimally. (ISSUE)\n- No issues with board boundaries or move validation in tested scenarios.\n- Draw detection and full board scenario not yet tested. (TODO)\n- Additional invalid input and edge cases not yet tested. (TODO)\n\nIssues/Feedback:\n----------------\n- AI (hard mode) did not block a clear four-in-a-row threat, allowing the player to win easily. This suggests the AI is not yet strong enough for 'hard' mode. (ISSUE)\n- Draw detection and full board scenario not yet tested. (TODO)\n- Additional invalid input and edge cases not yet tested. (TODO)\n\nNext Steps:\n-----------\n- Test draw detection and full board scenario.\n- Test additional invalid input and edge cases.\n- Recommend review and improvement of 'hard' AI logic to better block threats and play more competitively.\n\nConclusion:\n-----------\nInitial integration, basic play, and win detection are working as intended. 'Hard' AI needs improvement to meet strength expectations. Further testing required for draw logic and additional edge cases.\n\n---base_commit_hash---\n339909e6584779b84ef33c097654a6fa2ea5dfd1"}

Launch main.py and verify CLI prompts for difficulty and player stone selection.\n2. Play several moves as Player X against AI (easy and hard modes).\n3. Observe AI move validity and responsiveness.\n4. Test quitting the game with 'q'.\n5. Check for any crashes, unhandled exceptions, or logic errors.\n6. Test win/draw detection and edge cases.\n7. Test robustness against invalid input and full board scenarios.\n\nTest Results:\n-------------\n- CLI prompts for difficulty and player stone selection are clear and function as expected.\n- Board is displayed correctly after each move.\n- User move input is validated; invalid moves are rejected with appropriate messages.\n- AI responds with valid moves and does not crash, even on 'hard' mode.\n- AI moves are legal and placed on empty cells.\n- Game can be exited gracefully with 'q'.\n- No crashes or unhandled exceptions encountered during basic play.\n- Win detection works: Player X was able to win with a horizontal five-in-a-row, and the game announced the win and ended as expected.\n- 'Hard' AI mode (after update) still does not always block obvious four-in-a-row threats. In a vertical test, AI failed to block the fifth stone, allowing the player to win. (ISSUE)\n- No issues with board boundaries or move validation in tested scenarios.\n- Draw detection and full board scenario not yet tested. (TODO)\n- Additional invalid input and edge cases not yet tested. (TODO)\n\nIssues/Feedback:\n----------------\n- AI (hard mode, post-update) did not block a clear four-in-a-row threat, allowing the player to win easily. This suggests the AI is still not strong enough for 'hard' mode. (ISSUE)\n- Draw detection and full board scenario not yet tested. (TODO)\n- Additional invalid input and edge cases not yet tested. (TODO)\n\nNext Steps:\n-----------\n- Test draw detection and full board scenario.\n- Test additional invalid input and edge cases.\n- Recommend further review and improvement of 'hard' AI logic to better block threats and play more competitively.\n\nConclusion:\n-----------\nInitial integration, basic play, and win detection are working as intended. 'Hard' AI still needs improvement to meet strength expectations. Further testing required for draw logic and additional edge cases.\n\n---base_commit_hash---\n0f9b2c545c305182ddb79d1e9fd4117a1bd4bb63"}
