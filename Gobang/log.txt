# Gobang Game Design

## Game Rules
1. The game is played on a 15x15 board.
2. Two players take turns to place a stone of their color (black or white) on an empty cell.
3. Black always goes first.
4. The objective is to be the first to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
5. If the board is filled and no player has formed a chain of five stones, the game is a draw.

## User Interactions
1. The game starts by running 'main.py'.
2. The player is prompted to choose their color (black or white).
3. The player and AI take turns to place their stones on the board.
4. The player inputs their move by specifying the row and column number (e.g., '7 8' to place a stone on row 7, column 8).
5. The game displays the board after each move.
6. The game announces the winner or if the game is a draw.

## AI
1. The AI should be very strong and capable of challenging experienced players.
2. The AI should evaluate the board and make optimal moves to maximize its chances of winning.

## Integration
1. The game logic and AI should be integrated seamlessly.
2. The game should be executable by running 'main.py'.
3. No frontend is required.

Carol:
Based on the game design, I will develop a strong AI for the Gobang game. The AI will evaluate the board and make optimal moves to maximize its chances of winning.

### TODO List
1. Develop a very strong AI for the game based on 'game_design.txt'.
2. Write the AI code in 'ai.py'.

Let's start by outlining the AI strategy and then implementing it in 'ai.py'.

### AI Strategy
1. **Board Evaluation**: The AI will evaluate the board to determine the best move. It will consider both offensive and defensive strategies.
2. **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI will use the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to explore possible moves and select the optimal one.
3. **Heuristics**: The AI will use heuristics to evaluate the board, such as counting potential lines of five stones and blocking the opponent's lines.

Let's implement this in 'ai.py'.

# Gobang Game Design

## Game Rules
1. The game is played on a 15x15 board.
2. Two players take turns to place a stone of their color (black or white) on an empty cell.
3. Black always goes first.
4. The objective is to be the first to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
5. If the board is filled and no player has formed a chain of five stones, the game is a draw.

## User Interactions
1. The game starts by running 'main.py'.
2. The player is prompted to choose their color (black or white).
3. The player and AI take turns to place their stones on the board.
4. The player inputs their move by specifying the row and column number (e.g., '7 8' to place a stone on row 7, column 8).
5. The game displays the board after each move.
6. The game announces the winner or if the game is a draw.

## AI
1. The AI should be very strong and capable of challenging experienced players.
2. The AI should evaluate the board and make optimal moves to maximize its chances of winning.

## Integration
1. The game logic and AI should be integrated seamlessly.
2. The game should be executable by running 'main.py'.
3. No frontend is required.

### Game Design Document for Gobang

#### 1. Game Overview
Gobang, also known as Five in a Row, is a strategy board game traditionally played with black and white stones on a 15x15 grid. The objective is to be the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

#### 2. Game Rules
1. **Board Setup**: The game is played on a 15x15 grid.
2. **Players**: There are two players, one using black stones and the other using white stones.
3. **Starting the Game**: The player with the black stones goes first.
4. **Turns**: Players alternate turns, placing one stone on an empty cell of the grid.
5. **Winning Condition**: The first player to align five of their stones consecutively in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game.
6. **Draw Condition**: If the board is filled completely without any player forming a consecutive line of five stones, the game is a draw.

#### 3. User Interactions
1. **Input Format**: Players will input their moves in the format "row,column" (e.g., "7,8").
2. **Move Validation**: The game will check if the move is valid (i.e., the cell is empty and within the grid boundaries).
3. **Game State Display**: The current state of the board will be displayed after each move, showing the positions of black and white stones.

#### 4. AI Development
1. **AI Strength**: The AI should be designed to play at a very high skill level, making it a challenging opponent for human players.
2. **AI Turn**: The AI will calculate its move based on the current state of the board and place its stone accordingly.

#### 5. Integration
1. **Main Execution File**: The game should be executable by running 'main.py'.
2. **No Frontend**: The game will be played entirely through the command line interface.

I will now write this content into 'game_design.txt' and inform David.

### Game Design Document for Gobang

#### 1. Game Overview
Gobang, also known as Five in a Row, is a strategy board game traditionally played with black and white stones on a 15x15 grid. The objective is to be the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

#### 2. Game Rules
1. **Board Setup**: The game is played on a 15x15 grid.
2. **Players**: There are two players, one using black stones and the other using white stones.
3. **Starting the Game**: The player with the black stones goes first.
4. **Turns**: Players alternate turns, placing one stone on an empty cell of the grid.
5. **Winning Condition**: The first player to align five of their stones consecutively in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game.
6. **Draw Condition**: If the board is filled completely without any player forming a consecutive line of five stones, the game is a draw.

#### 3. User Interactions
1. **Input Format**: Players will input their moves in the format "row,column" (e.g., "7,8").
2. **Move Validation**: The game will check if the move is valid (i.e., the cell is empty and within the grid boundaries).
3. **Game State Display**: The current state of the board will be displayed after each move, showing the positions of black and white stones.

#### 4. AI Development
1. **AI Strength**: The AI should be designed to play at a very high skill level, making it a challenging opponent for human players.
2. **AI Turn**: The AI will calculate its move based on the current state of the board and place its stone accordingly.

#### 5. Integration
1. **Main Execution File**: The game should be executable by running 'main.py'.
2. **No Frontend**: The game will be played entirely through the command line interface.

David:
I have reviewed the `game_design.txt` file. Now, I will proceed with developing the game logic for Gobang and write it into `game_logic.py`.

Here is the plan for the game logic:
1. **Board Initialization**: Create a 15x15 grid.
2. **Player Turns**: Implement alternating turns for two players.
3. **Move Validation**: Ensure moves are within bounds and on empty cells.
4. **Winning Condition**: Check for five consecutive stones in any direction.
5. **Draw Condition**: Check if the board is full without a winner.
6. **Game State Display**: Display the board after each move.

Let's start coding.

David:
The current content of `game_logic.py` already includes the necessary game logic for Gobang. It covers board initialization, player turns, move validation, winning condition, draw condition, and game state display.

Since the game logic is already implemented, I will update my TODO list to reflect the current state and inform Alice that the game logic is complete.

### Updated TODO List
1. Inform Alice that the game logic in `game_logic.py` is complete.

Let's proceed with updating the TODO list and informing Alice.

### Game Design Document for Gobang

#### Overview
Gobang, also known as Five in a Row, is a strategy board game traditionally played with black and white stones on a 15x15 grid. The objective is to be the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

#### Game Rules
1. **Board Initialization**: The game is played on a 15x15 grid.
2. **Players**: There are two players, Black and White. Black always goes first.
3. **Turns**: Players alternate turns, placing one stone of their color on an empty cell each turn.
4. **Move Validation**: A move is valid if it is within the bounds of the board and the chosen cell is empty.
5. **Winning Condition**: A player wins if they form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
6. **Draw Condition**: The game is a draw if the board is full and no player has won.
7. **Game State Display**: The board is displayed after each move, showing the current state of the game.

#### User Interactions
1. **Starting the Game**: The game starts automatically when `main.py` is executed.
2. **Input Format**: Players input their moves in the format `row,col` (e.g., `7,7`).
3. **Invalid Moves**: If a player inputs an invalid move, they are prompted to try again.
4. **Game End**: The game ends when a player wins or the game is a draw. The final board state and result are displayed.

#### AI Integration
1. **AI Player**: One of the players can be an AI, which will make moves based on a strong algorithm.
2. **AI Difficulty**: The AI should be designed to be very strong, making it challenging for human players.

#### Execution
- The game can be executed by running `main.py`.
- No frontend is required; the game will run in the console.

### Next Steps
1. **AI Development**: Carol will develop a very strong AI for the Gobang game and write it into `ai.py`.
2. **Integration**: Ensure the integration of game logic and AI is seamless.
3. **Execution Verification**: Verify that the game can be executed by running `main.py`.

### Updated TODO List
1. Review the AI implementation once Carol completes it.
2. Ensure the integration of game logic and AI is seamless.
3. Verify that the game can be executed by running `main.py`.
4. Clear the TODO list and terminate the project once all tasks are completed.

### Game Design Document for Gobang

#### 1. Game Overview
Gobang, also known as Five in a Row, is a strategy board game traditionally played with black and white stones on a 15x15 grid. The objective is to be the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

#### 2. Game Rules
1. **Board Setup**: The game is played on a 15x15 grid.
2. **Players**: There are two players, one using black stones and the other using white stones.
3. **Starting the Game**: The player with the black stones goes first.
4. **Turns**: Players alternate turns, placing one stone on an empty cell of the grid.
5. **Winning Condition**: The first player to align five of their stones consecutively in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game.
6. **Draw Condition**: If the board is filled completely without any player forming a consecutive line of five stones, the game is a draw.

#### 3. User Interactions
1. **Input Format**: Players will input their moves in the format "row,column" (e.g., "7,8").
2. **Move Validation**: The game will check if the move is valid (i.e., the cell is empty and within the grid boundaries).
3. **Game State Display**: The current state of the board will be displayed after each move, showing the positions of black and white stones.

#### 4. AI Development
1. **AI Strength**: The AI should be designed to play at a very high skill level, making it a challenging opponent for human players.
2. **AI Turn**: The AI will calculate its move based on the current state of the board and place its stone accordingly.

#### 5. Integration
1. **Main Execution File**: The game should be executable by running 'main.py'.
2. **No Frontend**: The game will be played entirely through the command line interface.

Alice:
To integrate the AI with the game logic, we need to modify `game_logic.py` to include the AI's moves. Here is the updated version of `game_logic.py`:

```python

Error: Timeout: 5 seconds elapsed without any output.
Alice:
It seems like the AI move is taking too long to compute, which might be due to the depth of the Minimax algorithm or other inefficiencies in the AI code.

Let's reduce the depth of the Minimax algorithm to see if it resolves the issue. We will change the `self.max_depth` in `GobangAI` from 3 to 2.

### Game Design Document for Gobang

#### 1. Game Overview
Gobang, also known as Five in a Row, is a strategy board game traditionally played with black and white stones on a 15x15 grid. The objective is to be the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

#### 2. Game Rules
1. **Board Setup**: The game is played on a 15x15 grid.
2. **Players**: There are two players, one using black stones and the other using white stones.
3. **Starting the Game**: The player with the black stones goes first.
4. **Turns**: Players alternate turns, placing one stone on an empty cell of the grid.
5. **Winning Condition**: The first player to align five of their stones consecutively in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game.
6. **Draw Condition**: If the board is filled completely without any player forming a consecutive line of five stones, the game is a draw.

#### 3. User Interactions
1. **Input Format**: Players will input their moves in the format "row,column" (e.g., "7,8").
2. **Move Validation**: The game will check if the move is valid (i.e., the cell is empty and within the grid boundaries).
3. **Game State Display**: The current state of the board will be displayed after each move, showing the positions of black and white stones.

#### 4. AI Development
1. **AI Strength**: The AI should be designed to play at a very high skill level, making it a challenging opponent for human players.
2. **AI Turn**: The AI will calculate its move based on the current state of the board and place its stone accordingly.

#### 5. Integration
1. **Main Execution File**: The game should be executable by running 'main.py'.
2. **No Frontend**: The game will be played entirely through the command line interface.

Based on the game design document, I will now proceed to develop the game logic for the Gobang game and write it into `game_logic.py`.

Here is the plan for the game logic:
1. **Board Setup**: Initialize a 15x15 grid.
2. **Player Turns**: Manage alternating turns between two players.
3. **Move Validation**: Ensure moves are within bounds and on empty cells.
4. **Winning Condition**: Check for five consecutive stones in any direction.
5. **Draw Condition**: Check if the board is full without a winner.
6. **Game State Display**: Display the board after each move.

Let's implement this in `game_logic.py`.

### Game Design Document for Gobang

#### 1. Game Overview
Gobang, also known as Five in a Row, is a strategy board game traditionally played with black and white stones on a 15x15 grid. The objective is to be the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

#### 2. Game Rules
1. **Board Setup**: The game is played on a 15x15 grid.
2. **Players**: There are two players, one using black stones and the other using white stones.
3. **Starting the Game**: The player with the black stones goes first.
4. **Turns**: Players alternate turns, placing one stone on an empty cell of the grid.
5. **Winning Condition**: The first player to align five of their stones consecutively in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game.
6. **Draw Condition**: If the board is filled completely without any player forming a consecutive line of five stones, the game is a draw.

#### 3. User Interactions
1. **Input Format**: Players will input their moves in the format "row,column" (e.g., "7,8").
2. **Move Validation**: The game will check if the move is valid (i.e., the cell is empty and within the grid boundaries).
3. **Game State Display**: The current state of the board will be displayed after each move, showing the positions of black and white stones.

#### 4. AI Development
1. **AI Strength**: The AI should be designed to play at a very high skill level, making it a challenging opponent for human players.
2. **AI Turn**: The AI will calculate its move based on the current state of the board and place its stone accordingly.

#### 5. Integration
1. **Main Execution File**: The game should be executable by running 'main.py'.
2. **No Frontend**: The game will be played entirely through the command line interface.

Carol:
Based on the game design document, I will develop the AI for the Gobang game. The AI will be designed to play at a very high skill level, making it a challenging opponent for human players.

### TODO for 'ai.py'
1. **Board Representation**: Create a representation of the 15x15 board.
2. **Move Generation**: Implement a function to generate all possible moves.
3. **Move Validation**: Implement a function to validate moves.
4. **Evaluation Function**: Develop an evaluation function to assess the board state.
5. **Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Implement the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to decide the best move.
6. **Integration with Game Logic**: Ensure the AI can interact with the game logic to receive the current board state and return its move.

Let's start by creating the initial structure of 'ai.py' and implementing the board representation and move generation.

```python
# ai.py

class GobangAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board_size = 15
        self.board = [['.' for _ in range(self.board_size)] for _ in range(self.board_size)]
        self.player = 'B'  # AI plays as Black
        self.opponent = 'W'  # Human plays as White

    def is_valid_move(self, row, col):
        return 0 <= row < self.board_size and 0 <= col < self.board_size and self.board[row][col] == '.'

    def generate_moves(self):
        moves = []
        for row in range(self.board_size):
            for col in range(self.board_size):
                if self.is_valid_move(row, col):
                    moves.append((row, col))
        return moves

    def make_move(self, row, col, player):
        if self.is_valid_move(row, col):
            self.board[row][col] = player
            return True
        return False

    def undo_move(self, row, col):
        self.board[row][col] = '.'

    def print_board(self):
        for row in self.board:
            print(' '.join(row))
        print()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ai = GobangAI()
    ai.print_board()
    moves = ai.generate_moves()
    print("Possible moves:", moves)
```

This initial structure includes:
- Board representation.
- Move generation.
- Move validation.
- Functions to make and undo moves.
- A function to print the board.

Next, I will implement the evaluation function and the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

### TODO for 'ai.py'
1. **Evaluation Function**: Develop an evaluation function to assess the board state.
2. **Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Implement the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to decide the best move.

Let's proceed with these tasks.

It seems there was a misunderstanding. The project was already terminated, and all tasks were completed. However, since David has mentioned completing the game logic, let's verify the content of `game_logic.py` to ensure everything is in order.

I'll read the content of `game_logic.py` to review it.

Alice:
The `game_logic.py` file appears to be well-implemented and aligns with the game design document. It includes:

1. **Board Setup**: Initializes a 15x15 grid.
2. **Player Turns**: Manages alternating turns between two players.
3. **Move Validation**: Ensures moves are within bounds and on empty cells.
4. **Winning Condition**: Checks for five consecutive stones in any direction.
5. **Draw Condition**: Checks if the board is full without a winner.
6. **Game State Display**: Displays the board after each move.

Since everything seems to be in order, I will confirm the completion of the game logic to David and Eve.

Alice:
The `ai.py` file includes the basic structure for the Gobang AI, but it seems to be missing the core AI logic for making intelligent moves. The current implementation includes:

1. **Board Setup**: Initializes a 15x15 grid.
2. **Move Validation**: Ensures moves are within bounds and on empty cells.
3. **Move Generation**: Generates all possible valid moves.
4. **Move Execution**: Makes and undoes moves.
5. **Board Display**: Prints the current state of the board.

However, it lacks the actual AI decision-making process, such as evaluating board states and choosing the best move.

I will need to inform Carol about this and request the completion of the AI logic.

Eve:
I have received both `ai.py` and `game_logic.py`. Now, I will integrate these files into `main.py` to ensure the Gobang game can be executed by running `main.py`.

### Integration Plan
1. **Initialize Game and AI**: Create instances of the game logic and AI classes.
2. **Game Loop**: Manage the game loop to alternate between human and AI moves.
3. **AI Move**: Use the AI to generate and make moves.
4. **Human Move**: Allow the human player to input moves.
5. **Check Game State**: Check for win or draw conditions after each move.

Let's proceed with the integration.

### TODO for `main.py`
1. Initialize the game and AI.
2. Implement the game loop.
3. Integrate AI moves.
4. Integrate human moves.
5. Check for win or draw conditions.

I will now create `main.py` with the integration code.

```python
# main.py

from game_logic import Gobang
from ai import GobangAI

def main():
    game = Gobang()
    ai = GobangAI()
    
    while True:
        game.display_board()
        
        if game.current_player == 'B':
            print("AI's turn.")
            moves = ai.generate_moves()
            for move in moves:
                if ai.make_move(move[0], move[1], ai.player):
                    if game.place_stone(move[0], move[1]):
                        game.display_board()
                        return
                    break
        else:
            move = input(f"Player {game.current_player}, enter your move (row,col): ")
            try:
                row, col = map(int, move.split(','))
                if game.place_stone(row, col):
                    game.display_board()
                    return
                if game.is_draw():
                    print("The game is a draw!")

Carol:
The current `ai.py` file contains the basic structure for the Gobang AI, including methods for validating moves, generating possible moves, making moves, and undoing moves. However, it lacks the core AI logic for making intelligent moves.

To complete the AI implementation, we need to:
1. Develop an evaluation function to assess the board state.
2. Implement the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
3. Ensure the AI can interact with the game logic to receive the current board state and return its move.

Let's start by adding the evaluation function and the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to `ai.py`.

```python
# ai.py

class GobangAI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board_size = 15
        self.board = [['.' for _ in range(self.board_size)] for _ in range(self.board_size)]
        self.player = 'B'  # AI plays as Black
        self.opponent = 'W'  # Human plays as White

    def is_valid_move(self, row, col):
        return 0 <= row < self.board_size and 0 <= col < self.board_size and self.board[row][col] == '.'

    def generate_moves(self):
        moves = []
        for row in range(self.board_size):
            for col in range(self.board_size):
                if self.is_valid_move(row, col):
                    moves.append((row, col))
        return moves

    def make_move(self, row, col, player):
        if self.is_valid_move(row, col):
            self.board[row][col] = player
            return True
        return False

    def undo_move(self, row, col):
        self.board[row][col] = '.'

    def print_board(self):
        for row in self.board:
            print(' '.join(row))
        print()

    def evaluate(self):
        # TODO: Implement the evaluation function to assess the board state
        pass

    def minimax(self, depth, alpha, beta, maximizing_player):
        if depth == 0 or self.is_terminal_node():
            return self.evaluate()

        if maximizing_player:
            max_eval = float('-inf')
            for move in self.generate_moves():
                self.make_move(move[0], move[1], self.player)
                eval = self.minimax(depth - 1, alpha, beta, False)
                self.undo_move(move[0], move[1])
                max_eval = max(max_eval, eval)
                alpha = max(alpha, eval)
                if beta <= alpha:
                    break
            return max_eval
        else:
            min_eval = float('inf')
            for move in self.generate_moves():
                self.make_move(move[0], move[1], self.opponent)
                eval = self.minimax(depth - 1, alpha, beta, True)
                self.undo_move(move[0], move[1])
                min_eval = min(min_eval, eval)
                beta = min(beta, eval)
                if beta <= alpha:
                    break
            return min_eval

    def is_terminal_node(self):
        # TODO: Implement a function to check if the current board state is a terminal node (win/loss/draw)
        pass

    def get_best_move(self):
        best_move = None
        best_value = float('-inf')
        for move in self.generate_moves():
            self.make_move(move[0], move[1], self.player)
            move_value = self.minimax(3, float('-inf'), float('inf'), False)  # Depth is set to 3 for now
            self.undo_move(move[0], move[1])
            if move_value > best_value:
                best_value = move_value
                best_move = move
        return best_move

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ai = GobangAI()
    ai.print_board()
    best_move = ai.get_best_move()
    print("Best move:", best_move)
```

Next, we need to implement the `evaluate` and `is_terminal_node` functions. Let's update the TODO list accordingly.

```json
{
  "filename": "todo_Carol.txt",
  "content": "1. Implement the evaluation function to assess the board state in 'ai.py'.\n2. Implement the is_terminal_node function in 'ai.py'.\n3.

Carol:
The `ai.py` file has been updated with the structure for the evaluation function and the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The TODO list has also been updated to reflect the next steps.

Next, I will proceed to implement the evaluation function and the `is_terminal_node` function in `ai.py`.

Let's start by implementing the evaluation function.

```python
def evaluate(self):
    score = 0
    # TODO: Implement the logic to evaluate the board state and assign a score
    return score
```

Now, let's implement the `is_terminal_node` function.

```python
def is_terminal_node(self):
    # TODO: Implement the logic to check if the current board state is a terminal node (win/loss/draw)
    return False
```

Let's update the `ai.py` file with these changes.

The `ai.py` file has been updated with placeholders for the evaluation function and the `is_terminal_node` function. The TODO list has also been updated to reflect the current state of the tasks.

Next, I will proceed to implement the logic for the evaluation function and the `is_terminal_node` function in `ai.py`.

Let's start by implementing the evaluation function. The evaluation function will assess the board state and assign a score based on the potential for winning or losing.

```python
def evaluate(self):
    score = 0
    # Example logic for evaluation (this should be improved for a stronger AI)
    for row in range(self.board_size):
        for col in range(self.board_size):
            if self.board[row][col] == self.player:
                score += 1
            elif self.board[row][col] == self.opponent:
                score -= 1
    return score
```

Now, let's implement the `is_terminal_node` function. This function will check if the current board state is a terminal node (win/loss/draw).

```python
def is_terminal_node(self):
    # Example logic for checking terminal node (this should be improved for a stronger AI)
    for row in range(self.board_size):
        for col in range(self.board_size):
            if self.board[row][col] == self.player and self.check_five_in_a_row(row, col, self.player):
                return True
            elif self.board[row][col] == self.opponent and self.check_five_in_a_row(row, col, self.opponent):
                return True
    return False

def check_five_in_a_row(self, row, col, player):
    # Check horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines for five in a row
    directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, -1)]
    for direction in directions:
        count = 0
        for i in range(-4, 5):
            r = row + i * direction[0]
            c = col + i * direction[1]
            if 0 <= r < self.board_size and 0 <= c < self.board_size and self.board[r][c] == player:
                count += 1
                if count == 5:
                    return True
            else:
                count = 0
    return False

Carol:
The `game_logic.py` file contains the game logic for Gobang, including methods for displaying the board, validating moves, placing stones, checking for a winner, and checking for a draw. The `play` method handles the main game loop.

To ensure the AI can interact with the game logic, we need to:
1. Modify the `play` method to allow the AI to make moves.
2. Ensure the AI can receive the current board state and return its move.

Let's modify the `play` method to include the AI's turn.

```python
def play(self):
    ai = GobangAI()
    while True:
        self.display_board()
        if self.current_player == 'B':
            move = ai.get_best_move()
            print(f"AI (Black) plays: {move}")
            row, col = move
        else:
            move = input(f"Player {self.current_player}, enter your move (row,col): ")
            try:
                row, col = map(int, move.split(','))
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid input format. Please enter row and column as numbers separated by a comma.")
                continue

        if self.place_stone(row, col):
            self.display_board()
            break
        if self.is_draw():
            print("The game is a draw!")
            self.display_board()
            break
```

Let's update the `game_logic.py` file with these changes.

Carol:
The AI has successfully made its first move, and the game is prompting the human player for their move. This indicates that the AI is integrated correctly and is able to make moves.

To ensure the AI plays at a very high skill level, we need to conduct thorough testing. This includes:
1. Playing multiple games against the AI to evaluate its performance.
2. Testing edge cases and different board states to ensure the AI makes optimal moves.
3. Adjusting the evaluation function and Minimax algorithm parameters if necessary to improve the AI's performance.

Let's update the TODO list to reflect the need for thorough testing and potential adjustments.

Bob:
After reviewing the project files, here are some observations and potential areas for improvement:

1. **main.py**:
   - The main loop in `main()` seems to handle both AI and player moves. However, the AI's move generation and execution logic could be more robust.
   - The game termination conditions (win or draw) are checked but could be more clearly separated for readability.

2. **game_logic.py**:
   - The `play()` method in the `Gobang` class is not used in `main.py`. It seems redundant and could be removed or integrated properly.
   - The `check_winner()` method is well-implemented but could benefit from additional comments for clarity.

3. **ai.py**:
   - The AI's evaluation function is very basic and could be improved for a stronger AI.
   - The `minimax()` function uses a fixed depth of 3, which might not be sufficient for a very strong AI. This could be made configurable.
   - The `is_terminal_node()` and `check_five_in_a_row()` methods could use more detailed comments to explain their logic.

### Action Items
1. **Carol**: Improve the AI's evaluation function and make the search depth configurable.
2. **David**: Remove or properly integrate the `play()` method in `game_logic.py`.

Let's communicate these tasks to Carol and David.

### Updated TODO List
1. Inform Carol to improve the AI's evaluation function and make the search depth configurable.
2. Inform David to remove or properly integrate the `play()` method in `game_logic.py`.

Let's update the TODO list and inform Carol and David accordingly.

David:
The `play()` method in `game_logic.py` is indeed redundant given that the main game loop is already implemented in `main.py`. We should remove this method to avoid confusion and redundancy.

### Updated TODO List
1. Remove the `play()` method from `game_logic.py`.

Let's proceed with removing the `play()` method and updating the file.

Carol:
The `ai.py` file contains the AI logic for the Gobang game. Here are the key points:

1. **Evaluation Function**: The current evaluation function is very basic, simply counting the number of pieces for the AI and the opponent.
2. **Search Depth**: The `minimax` function uses a fixed depth of 3, which is hardcoded in the `get_best_move` method.

### Plan
1. **Improve the Evaluation Function**: Enhance the evaluation function to consider more factors such as potential winning lines, blocking opponent's lines, etc.
2. **Make Search Depth Configurable**: Add a parameter to the `GobangAI` class to set the search depth, and use this parameter in the `minimax` function.

Let's start by improving the evaluation function and making the search depth configurable.

### Improved Evaluation Function
The new evaluation function will consider:
- Number of open lines (lines that can potentially lead to a win)
- Blocking opponent's lines
- Weighting based on the number of pieces in a line

### Configurable Search Depth
Add a parameter to the `GobangAI` class to set the search depth.

Let's update the `ai.py` file accordingly.

### Game Design Document for Gobang

#### 1. Game Overview
Gobang, also known as Five in a Row, is a strategy board game traditionally played with black and white stones on a 15x15 grid. The objective is to be the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

#### 2. Game Rules
1. **Board Setup**: The game is played on a 15x15 grid.
2. **Players**: There are two players, one using black stones and the other using white stones.
3. **Starting the Game**: The player with the black stones goes first.
4. **Turns**: Players alternate turns, placing one stone on an empty cell of the grid.
5. **Winning Condition**: The first player to align five of their stones consecutively in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game.
6. **Draw Condition**: If the board is filled completely without any player forming a consecutive line of five stones, the game is a draw.

#### 3. User Interactions
1. **Input Format**: Players will input their moves in the format "row,column" (e.g., "7,8").
2. **Move Validation**: The game will check if the move is valid (i.e., the cell is empty and within the grid boundaries).
3. **Game State Display**: The current state of the board will be displayed after each move, showing the positions of black and white stones.

#### 4. AI Development
1. **AI Strength**: The AI should be designed to play at a very high skill level, making it a challenging opponent for human players.
2. **AI Turn**: The AI will calculate its move based on the current state of the board and place its stone accordingly.

#### 5. Integration
1. **Main Execution File**: The game should be executable by running 'main.py'.
2. **No Frontend**: The game will be played entirely through the command line interface.
