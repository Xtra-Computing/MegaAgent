Title: Scala AI City: Scala pitches $50bn Brazil data center campus of up to 4.7GW
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/scala-ai-city-scala-pitches-50bn-brazil-data-center-campus-of-up-to-47gw/
Content: DigitalBridge-owned Scala Data Centers plans to build an enormous data center campus in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul.

The company has pitched developing a campus that could cost R$300 billion (US$50bn) and grow to 4.75GW. But, for now, it will build a 54MW data center for an investment of R$3bn (US$500m).

Scala has already acquired around 700 hectares for the 'AI City,' in the municipality of Eldorado do Sul, 32 kilometers from Porto Alegre.

“This is our response to the demand for artificial intelligence," Marcos Peigo, Scala CEO, told

*DCD Brazil*, which first reported the news.

"What AI is bringing is more than an opportunity for the company; it is an opportunity for the country," he said (translated).

Content: ## Net Absorption

### North America

Net absorption in the top four North American markets surged 101% year-over-year in Q1 to 1,668.5 MW, driven by continued strong demand in Northern Virginia and increased activity in Phoenix and Atlanta. Absorption was primarily driven by hyperscale expansion and new power availability across key submarkets, particularly in Atlanta’s booming metro area.

### Europe

Net absorption among the top four European markets increased by 300.5 MW in Q1, down from an increase of 487.6 MW a year earlier. Demand easily outstripped new supply. Frankfurt and Paris accounted for most of the demand, both buoyed by new hyperscale and AI requirements.

### Asia-Pacific

Asia-Pacific leasing demand remained stable in Q1, driven primarily by enterprise colocation and cloud services adoption. Demand from the AI segment is also contributing to absorption both for training workloads and larger IT capacity deployments.
