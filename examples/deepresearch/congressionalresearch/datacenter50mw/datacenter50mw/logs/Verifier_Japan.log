Wonder Valley AI Data Centre Industrial Park | capacity_mw | possible overstatement | Multiple sources (Gensler, DataX Connect, Alberta Major Projects) indicate the full buildout could reach 7,500 MW (7.5 GW), not 7,000 MW. The 7,000 figure may refer to acreage, not MW. | https://majorprojects.alberta.ca/details/Wonder-Valley-AI-Data-Centre-Park/11477, https://dataxconnect.com/insights-largest-ai-data-centre-park/, https://www.gensler.com/projects/wonder-valley-data-centre-park
Wonder Valley AI Data Centre Industrial Park | acreage | possible confusion | 7,000 acres is supported by multiple sources, but Gensler notes the campus could eventually encompass over 8,000 acres with 5,000 more optioned. 7,000 is a conservative figure. | https://www.gensler.com/projects/wonder-valley-data-centre-park, https://siteselection.com/data-centers-stars-align-in-wonder-valley/

Content: ##### Oracle New Cloud Region in Tokyo

Oracle Corporation has announced the opening of its cloud service data center region in Tokyo. The facility is now available for customer use.

The Tech giant claims that the 50 biggest companies (by revenue) in Japan use Oracle software in their own data centers. Hence, this new Tokyo facility addresses the needs for high performance, security, resiliency, and local data residency that Japanese organizations require to increase cloud adoption with confidence.

“Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides powerful data solutions that aren’t available on any other cloud platform, and we’re excited to make these solutions available locally in Japan. Some of our most important solutions are Exadata Cloud Service, Autonomous Database services, and high-performance computing (HPC) options, including our state-of-the-art GPU and HPC compute shapes,” said Andrew Reichman, Director of Product Management, Oracle.

OCI offers its cloud services in all of its public cloud regions and dedicated cloud regions. However, certain specialized or emerging services are available only in select regions. For more information, see Service Availability.... ## Resource Availability



The following sections list the resource types based on their availability: across regions, within a single region, or within a single availability domain.

**Tip**

In general: IAM resources are cross-region. DB Systems, instances, and volumes are specific to an availability domain. Everything else is regional. Exception: Subnets were originally designed to be specific to an availability domain. Now, you can create regional subnets, which are what Oracle recommends.

A region is a localized geographic area, and an availability domain is one or more data centers located within a region. Each region is independent of other regions and can be separated by vast distances—across countries or even continents. Oracle Cloud regions support every OCI service and feature and are available to customers anywhere in the world. Each region is made up of one or more data centers to support availability and redundancy within the region. You choose the cl...

Content: ## Service Availability Across Regions



OCI offers its cloud services in all of its public cloud regions and dedicated cloud regions. However, certain specialized or emerging services are available only in select regions. For more information, see Service Availability.... ## Resource Availability



The following sections list the resource types based on their availability: across regions, within a single region, or within a single availability domain.

**Tip**

In general: IAM resources are cross-region. DB Systems, instances, and volumes are specific to an availability domain. Everything else is regional. Exception: Subnets were originally designed to be specific to an availability domain. Now, you can create regional subnets, which are what Oracle recommends.

We understand the importance of knowing that your applications are physically and logically secure and highly available. For this reason, we want to provide you with a look inside our world-class data centers and give you an idea of how they operate.

But first, let’s back up a moment and look at Oracle Cloud regions and what they are.... Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is physically hosted in regions and availability domains. A region is a localized geographic area, and an availability domain is one or more data centers located within a region. Each region is independent of other regions and can be separated by vast distances—across countries or even continents. Oracle Cloud regions support every OCI service and feature and are available to customers anywhere in the world. Each region is made up of one or more data centers to support availability and redundancy within the region. You choose the cl...

URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/oracle-launches-smaller-oci-dedicated-region-announces-nri-and-vodafone-as-customers/
Content: Oracle has launched new versions of its on-premise OCI Dedicated Region infrastructure, and announced NRI and Vodafone as customers.

Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer is Oracle Cloud Infrastructure deployed in the customer’s own on-premise data center as a managed service and single-tenant cloud. Microsoft, AWS, and Google all offer similar on-premise compute offerings that can be managed through cloud dashboards.

The company has announced a lower entry point for OCI Dedicated Region and a preview of Compute Cloud@Customer services, bringing more than 100 OCI public cloud services into customers’ data centers.

Oracle said the new OCI Dedicated Region requires 60-75 percent less data center space and power on average, with a ‘significantly lower’ entry price of around $1 million a year for a typical customer. The new OCI Compute Cloud@Customer is a rack-scale solution meant for smaller environments than OCI Dedicated Region.

URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/digital-realty-breaks-ground-on-31mw-inzai-data-center-in-japan/
Content: Digital Realty has broken ground on a new data center outside Tokyo, Japan.

Construction work is underway on what will be the third data center at the NRT campus in Inzai, Chiba prefecture.

The new 31MW facility, known as NRT14, is expected to open in December 2025.

Developed by MC Digital Realty, Digital Realty's joint venture with Mitsubishi Corporation, the new facility will be configurable to support private AI deployments at densities up to 70kW per rack via air-assisted liquid cooling.

"The addition of NRT14 to our NRT campus will further our ability to deliver robust and flexible AI-ready data center environments to support customers' digital transformation and innovation goals,” said Kosei Hatakeyama, representative director and CEO of MC Digital Realty. “The construction demonstrates our commitment to the continued development of our NRT campus to ensure we are meeting the ever-evolving needs of our customers and the broader industry in Japan."
