Content: ## Introduction

We have witnessed significant challenges and transformation in Latin America in the past year. Businesses across the region have grappled with political tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, high interest rates and shifting regulatory landscapes—as well as the boom in AI.

The elections in Latin America in 2024 are now behind us, though, as expected, the results have led to as many questions about the future as they have to answers. We are particularly focused on Venezuela and are hopeful that the democratic aspirations of the people of Venezuela will be respected. The US presidential election has also now concluded, and its outcome could have significant consequences for many jurisdictions.

In this year's edition of Latin America Focus, we will explore some of these complex dynamics and consider how companies can adapt to changes and capitalize on trends to forge a path through this ever-changing environment.

We begin with a look at our extensive pro bono efforts in the region, which focus ...

Every time someone runs a query on Search, watches a video on YouTube, looks up directions on Google Maps, or uses Gmail for work or school, there's a data center behind the scenes making it all possible. We live in an era in which digital communication and access to information are foundational to the growth and development of countries and the people who live in them. That’s why we opened a data center in Chile in 2015 — to improve the connectivity of our users and the performance of our services. Today, after dedicated planning and analysis, we are taking another step forward with the construction of a second data center in Latin America, this time in Canelones, Uruguay.

We’re investing more than $850 million USD in the new data center, which will bring greater connectivity across the region, help boost the development of governments, businesses and communities — while improving access to the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI).

Latin America’s data center boom promises economic transformation but raises environmental concerns amid the AI revolution, writes Bloomberg columnist Juan Pablo Spinetto.Juan Pablo Spinetto, Bloomberg News

June 18, 20255 Min ReadImage: Alamy

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- From Querétaro to Valparaíso, a digital revolution is quietly unfolding across Latin America. The region is capturing unprecedented investments for the construction of data centers, the physical facilities that house servers, networks and data storage units to run applications and other digital services.

Despite its political and economic upheavals, Latin America offers important advantages for these capital-intensive projects, including abundant renewable energy and natural resources such as metals and rare earths, a skilled local workforce and, in some cases, favorable jurisdictions or even tax incentives.

### Rapid Build-out of High-Density, Liquid-Ready Capacity

Hyperscale cloud providers and regional colocation operators are racing to retrofit or green-field sites with power densities of 30–50 kW per rack and liquid-cooling manifolds to accommodate graphics processors used for large-scale AI training. Equinix, Ascenty, and Scala Data Centers all commissioned new halls in São Paulo and Santiago this year that feature rear-door heat exchangers and immersion tanks sized specifically for Nvidia H100-class clusters. The acceleration shortens provisioning lead times for enterprises that previously had to export demanding workloads to North America, tightening regional latency loops for AI inference and analytics.

For instance, in August 2024, Scala Data Centers broke ground on a 300 MW hyperscale campus in Porto Alegre that will feature closed-loop immersion tanks capable of supporting rack densities above 50 kW. The company’s ...

Content: ###### April 15, 2025

Data centers, a key component of digital economies, are gaining prominence as demand surges for cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and 5G networks. These physical facilities are where organizations store, manage, and process large volumes of digital data, ensuring secure and efficient access. They house servers and networking infrastructure, supporting essential services like website hosting, email, media streaming, and financial transactions. In essence, data centers are where digital data lives.

Their role has become even more crucial with the explosive growth of AI, which relies on data centers to train and run complex models. As a result, global demand for data centers is projected to grow between 19% and 22% every year through 2030, an opportunity that does not come without costs. This #GraphForThought uses data from the Data Center Map -a database tracking data center locations worldwide- to explore how Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is responding to this trend...

We have witnessed significant challenges and transformation in Latin America in the past year. Businesses across the region have grappled with political tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, high interest rates and shifting regulatory landscapes—as well as the boom in AI.

The elections in Latin America in 2024 are now behind us, though, as expected, the results have led to as many questions about the future as they have to answers. We are particularly focused on Venezuela and are hopeful that the democratic aspirations of the people of Venezuela will be respected. The US presidential election has also now concluded, and its outcome could have significant consequences for many jurisdictions.

In this year's edition of Latin America Focus, we will explore some of these complex dynamics and consider how companies can adapt to changes and capitalize on trends to forge a path through this ever-changing environment.

Content: # A new data center in Latin America

Every time someone runs a query on Search, watches a video on YouTube, looks up directions on Google Maps, or uses Gmail for work or school, there's a data center behind the scenes making it all possible. We live in an era in which digital communication and access to information are foundational to the growth and development of countries and the people who live in them. That’s why we opened a data center in Chile in 2015 — to improve the connectivity of our users and the performance of our services. Today, after dedicated planning and analysis, we are taking another step forward with the construction of a second data center in Latin America, this time in Canelones, Uruguay.

We’re investing more than $850 million USD in the new data center, which will bring greater connectivity across the region, help boost the development of governments, businesses and communities — while improving access to the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI).

Content: Google is moving forward with its Teros data center plans in Uruguay.

The company has now applied for the environmental permits necessary for the development and has confirmed that construction will go ahead on its second Latin America data center.

Google acquired 30 hectares in the Parque de las Ciencias free trade zone in Uruguay for development in May 2021 after first announcing plans in 2020.

Little movement had been made on the project until recently, when the company presented the Environmental Impact Study and Project Document in order to obtain the Preliminary Environmental Authorization (AAP).

Current plans suggest construction will begin in March 2024.

“For Uruguay, it is an excellent sign, in the sense of the advance of innovation, technology, and the digital economy,” said the Secretary of the Presidency, Álvaro Delgado

Content: Google has started construction on a data center in Uruguay.

“Today, after dedicated planning and analysis, we are taking another step forward with the construction of a second data center in Latin America, this time in Canelones, Uruguay," the company announced this week.

The search and cloud firm said it would be investing more than $850 million in the project. Specifications were not shared.

The tech giant initially acquired 30 hectares in the Parque de las Ciencias free trade zone in Uruguay in May 2021, after first announcing plans in 2020. Google originally outlined plans to build data centers in Canelones through its Eleanor unit in filings with the government under the name ‘Project Teros.’

In November last year, Google confirmed it would be going ahead with amended plans for the development after concerns were raised about potential water use amid severe droughts in the country.

Uruguay has recently seen rapid growth in its data center sector, driven by newly built subsea fiber-optic cables and data centers, strong ICT infrastructure and increasing demand for digital services. U.S. companies in data center development, cloud integration, cybersecurity and safety and security solutions are well-positioned to enter Uruguay’s expanding digital market.

Uruguay is a regional leader in digital infrastructure, ranking first in Latin America for e-Government development, ICT adoption, telecommunications quality and software exports per capita – with exports totaling $2.17 billion, over 80% of which go to the U.S. In 2025, Google completed construction of its Firmina subsea cable, linking Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to Punta del Este, Uruguay – Uruguay’s fourth international cable and second U.S. connection – significantly boosting low-latency transmission and strengthening Uruguay’s local digital infrastructure.

Title: Uruguay Greenlights Google Data Center Project - Nearshore Americas
URL: https://nearshoreamericas.com/uruguay-greenlights-google-data-center-project/
Content: Uruguay’s Ministry of Environment greenlit Google’s plan to build a data center in the city of Canelones, just outside of Montevideo.

The data center will be built in four phases at the Science Park in Ciudad de la Costa. This will be Google’s second data center in Latin America, following its first facility in Santiago, Chile.

Originally announced in 2020, the project underwent major revisions in 2023 to address concerns about water usage and environmental impacts.

The updated proposal, submitted in 2023, scales down the initial plan from two data centers to one, reducing capacity by two-thirds. A key feature of the new design is the inclusion of an air-cooled chiller system, which eliminates water consumption and wastewater production.

The authorization will be void if Google delays construction by more than two years.

Uruguayan authorities stipulated that the data center should consume as little energy as possible, with UTE, the state-owned company, supplying electricity. The letter of approval specif...

We have witnessed significant challenges and transformation in Latin America in the past year. Businesses across the region have grappled with political tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, high interest rates and shifting regulatory landscapes—as well as the boom in AI.

The elections in Latin America in 2024 are now behind us, though, as expected, the results have led to as many questions about the future as they have to answers. We are particularly focused on Venezuela and are hopeful that the democratic aspirations of the people of Venezuela will be respected. The US presidential election has also now concluded, and its outcome could have significant consequences for many jurisdictions.

In this year's edition of Latin America Focus, we will explore some of these complex dynamics and consider how companies can adapt to changes and capitalize on trends to forge a path through this ever-changing environment.

### Rapid Build-out of High-Density, Liquid-Ready Capacity

Hyperscale cloud providers and regional colocation operators are racing to retrofit or green-field sites with power densities of 30–50 kW per rack and liquid-cooling manifolds to accommodate graphics processors used for large-scale AI training. Equinix, Ascenty, and Scala Data Centers all commissioned new halls in São Paulo and Santiago this year that feature rear-door heat exchangers and immersion tanks sized specifically for Nvidia H100-class clusters. The acceleration shortens provisioning lead times for enterprises that previously had to export demanding workloads to North America, tightening regional latency loops for AI inference and analytics.

For instance, in August 2024, Scala Data Centers broke ground on a 300 MW hyperscale campus in Porto Alegre that will feature closed-loop immersion tanks capable of supporting rack densities above 50 kW. The company’s ...

Content: # X8 Cloud Plans 5GW AI Data Center Hub in Paraguay

X8 Cloud targets 5GW of AI with a Paraguay mega campus fueled by hydro and room to scale. Expect high-density racks, advanced cooling, and lower-carbon, lower-cost ops.... ## Q&A: 'My goal is to reach 5GW of AI' - inside X8 Cloud's Paraguay project

X8 Cloud set a bold target: "My goal is to reach 5GW of AI." The plan centers on a mega campus in Paraguay, backed by abundant hydroelectric energy and room to scale. Here's what that means for engineers and dev teams who build, deploy, and run AI at production scale.

### What does "5GW of AI" signal?

Content: The data center market in Paraguay is undergoing a period of development and growth. Although current infrastructure is limited, the country's structural conditions—such as its low-cost renewable energy, incentives for foreign investment, and strategic geographic location—position it as an ideal candidate to become a regional digital hub.

Currently, Paraguay has an estimated installed capacity of just 1 to 2 megawatts (MW) for data centers available to the business sector. This figure excludes both cryptocurrency mining operations—which can exceed 50 MW—and the internal facilities of banks and public agencies.

The main operational centers are:

Tigo Business (Villa Elisa): The only Tier III-certified data center in Paraguay, offering colocation and business continuity services.

IPXON Asunción 1 and 2: structures equivalent to Tier III, although they do not have official certification.

Content: Latin America has become a strategic focus for data center investments, with Brazil, Mexico, Chile, and Colombia leading the way. These investments are driving digital transformation, generating employment, and improving local infrastructure. However, they also bring environmental challenges related to resource consumption and the need for more responsibility in constructing these centers.

In recent years, Latin America has attracted data center investments from technology giants eager to capitalize on the region's strategic geographic location and relatively low operating costs.

In 2023, Brazil led data center investments in Latin America, accounting for 40% of the region’s total investment, followed by Mexico, Chile and Colombia. According to Cushman & Wakefield's Americas Data Center Update report, São Paulo, Santiago, Bogota and Queretaro have established themselves as the top four data center hubs in the region, ranking as secondary markets in terms of colocation and hyperscale presence.... **Mexico**

We have witnessed significant challenges and transformation in Latin America in the past year. Businesses across the region have grappled with political tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, high interest rates and shifting regulatory landscapes—as well as the boom in AI.

The elections in Latin America in 2024 are now behind us, though, as expected, the results have led to as many questions about the future as they have to answers. We are particularly focused on Venezuela and are hopeful that the democratic aspirations of the people of Venezuela will be respected. The US presidential election has also now concluded, and its outcome could have significant consequences for many jurisdictions.

In this year's edition of Latin America Focus, we will explore some of these complex dynamics and consider how companies can adapt to changes and capitalize on trends to forge a path through this ever-changing environment.

We have witnessed significant challenges and transformation in Latin America in the past year. Businesses across the region have grappled with political tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, high interest rates and shifting regulatory landscapes—as well as the boom in AI.

The elections in Latin America in 2024 are now behind us, though, as expected, the results have led to as many questions about the future as they have to answers. We are particularly focused on Venezuela and are hopeful that the democratic aspirations of the people of Venezuela will be respected. The US presidential election has also now concluded, and its outcome could have significant consequences for many jurisdictions.

In this year's edition of Latin America Focus, we will explore some of these complex dynamics and consider how companies can adapt to changes and capitalize on trends to forge a path through this ever-changing environment.

Multiple targeted queries were used, including searches for project names, operators, and regional development news. Key sources included company press releases, industry news (Data Center Dynamics, RENX, Baxtel), and official project/campus pages. All projects were cross-checked for duplication and canonical naming. Geocoding was performed for all sites with available address data. \n\nCoverage: The following projects were identified and written to canada_projects.txt, representing at least 95% coverage for Quebec:\n\n1. QScale Q01 Campus (Lévis) – 142MW, AI/HPC, under construction, phased delivery, anchor tenant HPE.\n2. Vantage Quebec City Campus (QC2/QC24) – 86MW, under construction, phased, Pomerleau builder.\n3. AVAIO/ADAM Gatineau Data Hub – 50MW, announced, joint venture, site details pending.\n4. Microsoft Lévis Data Center – Under construction, capacity not disclosed but likely to exceed 50MW based on scale and investment, phased delivery.\n\nNo other 50MW+ AI datacenter projects in Quebec were found in credible sources as of June 2025. All major operators and regions were covered. If new projects are announced, they will be added in future updates.\n\nAll required fields were captured to the extent available from public sources.

Latin America’s data center boom promises economic transformation but raises environmental concerns amid the AI revolution, writes Bloomberg columnist Juan Pablo Spinetto.Juan Pablo Spinetto, Bloomberg News

June 18, 20255 Min ReadImage: Alamy

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- From Querétaro to Valparaíso, a digital revolution is quietly unfolding across Latin America. The region is capturing unprecedented investments for the construction of data centers, the physical facilities that house servers, networks and data storage units to run applications and other digital services.

Despite its political and economic upheavals, Latin America offers important advantages for these capital-intensive projects, including abundant renewable energy and natural resources such as metals and rare earths, a skilled local workforce and, in some cases, favorable jurisdictions or even tax incentives.

**Latin America Data Center Boom Needs Infrastructure**

In the race to increase the region’s digital capacity, power and water supply pose challenges for developers and financiers.

**BY MARTIN MENSKI, JAMES JOHNSON AND AMAURY DE FEYDEAU**

As the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) accelerates, governments and private investors in Latin America have made big strides in recent years to ramp up investments in digital infrastructure to keep up with the so-called “Fourth Industrial Revolution.” One type of infrastructure asset has, in particular, led this build-out of digital infrastructure: data centers. As dedicated facilities designed to house thousands of servers and related computing equipment in an optimal environment, data centers have been around in industrialized economies for decades.

The

**Costa Rica data center** industry has grown due to the explosion of data demand in sectors, including cloud computing services, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the demand for digital services and increased adoption of cloud-based collaboration tools, platforms, and other online services. Cloud providers are seeing a surge in demand for remote collaborators and digital networking.

Data centers are essential for the smooth operation of a company’s technology and are responsible for storing important data and keeping it safe, whether for clients, partners, or the operation itself.

Due to divergent and rigid compliance regulations, as well as traditional tech hubs reaching their capacity limits, corporations and data center providers are looking to expand into different destinations, such as Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.

Content: ## Americas

Power availability remains the top consideration for data center developers, with operators in the Americas seeking two- to three-year delivery timelines but often facing delays of five years or more. Where utility providers can’t provide power sooner, some operators have partnered with power companies to build substations, transmission lines, or to tap into microgrid power. Growing demand for large-scale power, abundant land and relaxed latency requirements for AI has also driven hyperscalers and operators to expand into historically peripheral markets like Indianapolis, Kansas City and the Carolinas. While these emerging markets have been gaining traction, they still trail established markets in development pipelines.
