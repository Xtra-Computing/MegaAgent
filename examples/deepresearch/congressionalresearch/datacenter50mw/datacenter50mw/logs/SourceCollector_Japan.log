Impact of AI Growth – Tokyo Data Center Market
The growth of AI is reshaping Tokyo’s data center market, driving significant demand for high-performance 
computing, specialized infrastructure, and new hyperscale facilities. New hyperscale facilities aiming to 
deploy AI infrastructure need to deploy high-density racks and advanced cooling technologies, support 
high-performance networking, and ensure security and compliance—all while maintaining scalability, energy 
efficiency, and adaptability to meet the evolving demands of AI workloads.
There are currently well-established data center hubs in the Tokyo market. However, due to the recent surge 
in data center development and demand within these hubs, Structure Research believes that this trend will 
eventually lead to supply constraints, particularly regarding power availability. The existing utility grid and 
infrastructure may not be able to support additional hyperscale data centers.

At Amazon Web Services (AWS), we are committed to supporting Japan’s digital transformation (DX) ambition by helping Japanese customers modernize IT and innovate securely at pace, driving sustainable economic growth. I’m humbled to share that since 2011, AWS has invested ¥1.35 trillion in total capital and operational expenditure associated with our two AWS infrastructure Regions in the country. In 2022, we invested ¥348 billion in capital and operational investments in our data centers in Japan. During 2011-2022, the investment in our AWS Regions in Japan resulted in ¥1.31 trillion gross domestic product (GDP) contributed to the Japanese economy.

The trend towards increasingly large-scale data centers (DCs) is gaining serious traction, highlighted by Tsukuba’s first hyperscale data center project, which drew significant attention during its bidding phase. This initiative is spearheaded by Australia’s Goodman Group. In 2022, the company successfully acquired approximately 45 hectares of land in response to a public call for proposals conducted by Tsukuba City as part of its industrial promotion strategy. This region, developed as a “Science City,” already possesses well-established infrastructure, including telecommunications, power, and water, along with excellent accessibility from the Tokyo metropolitan area. Furthermore, it offers significant potential for further development, making it one of the few locations in Japan equipped to host hyperscale data centers.

AWS has had a presence in Japan for a long time! We opened the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region in March 2011, added a third Availability Zone (AZ) in 2012, and a fourth in 2018. Since that launch, customers in Japan and around the world have used the region to host an incredibly wide variety of applications!

We opened the Osaka Local Region in 2018 to give our customers in Japan a disaster recovery option for their workloads. Located 400 km from Tokyo, the Osaka Local Region used an isolated, fault-tolerant design contained within a single data center.

**From Local to Standard** I am happy to announce that the Osaka Local Region has been expanded and is a now a standard AWS region, complete with three Availability Zones. As is always the case with AWS, the AZs are designed to provide physical redundancy, and are able to withstand power outages, internet downtime, floods, and other natural disasters...

by Tadao Nagasaki on 10 OCT 2022 in

At Amazon Web Services (AWS), we are committed to supporting Japan’s digital transformation (DX) ambition by helping Japanese customers modernize IT and innovate securely at pace, driving sustainable economic growth. I’m humbled to share that since 2011, AWS has invested ¥1.35 trillion in total capital and operational expenditure associated with our two AWS infrastructure Regions in the country. In 2022, we invested ¥348 billion in capital and operational investments in our data centers in Japan. During 2011-2022, the investment in our AWS Regions in Japan resulted in ¥1.31 trillion gross domestic product (GDP) contributed to the Japanese economy. In 2022, our infrastructure also supported over 20,300 full-time jobs at third-party vendors in skilled professions.

Content: NTT has broken ground on a new data center outside Tokyo, Japan.

“NTT Global Data Centers Japan and Tepco Power Grid officially held a ground-breaking ceremony earlier this month for the construction of a new 50MW data center campus located approximately 30km east of central Tokyo, in Shiroi City, Chiba,” the company announced on LinkedIn this week.

The first data center on the campus, the Shiroi Data Center (SHR1) is expected to be completed by April 2027. NTT said the 24MW building will support AI, cloud computing, and the next generation of digital services.

NTT GDC currently lists three data centers in Japan: Tokyo 11 in Tokyo, Osaka 7 in Osaka, and the upcoming Keihanna facility outside Osaka and Kyoto. The wider NTT company operates a number of other facilities across the country.

NTT and Tepco Power Grid formed a joint venture to develop data centers in Japan last year, with plans to develop 50MW of IT capacity in the Inzai-Shiroi area of Greater Tokyo. At the time, the companies said the first pha...

Content: ### AWS will invest $15B+ in Japan to expand its local data center footprint

Amazon Web Services Inc. will invest 2.26 trillion yen, or about $15.24 billion, in Japan through 2027 to expand its local data center network.

The cloud giant announced the project today during a news conference in Tokyo. The investment is worth significantly more than the 1.51 trillion yen AWS spent on its Japanese data centers between 2011 and 2022. According to the Amazon.com Inc. unit, the infrastructure expansion will add the equivalent of $38 billion to Japan’s gross domestic project.

Reuters reported that AWS will expand its infrastructure capacity in Tokyo and Osaka, the two cities where its local data centers are based. In 2021, the cloud giant disclosed that those data centers support hundreds of thousands of local customers.

The Amazon unit first moved into the Japanese cloud market in 2011 by opening an AWS region in Tokyo. A region is a cluster of availability zones, which in turn each include one or more data cente...

Content: Amazon Web Services (AWS) has begun using low-carbon concrete in the construction of new data centers in Japan.

The company is currently planning expansions of its facilities in Tokyo and Osaka and has committed to investing 2.26 trillion yen ($15.24bn) in expanding its cloud computing infrastructure in Japan by 2027.

The tech giant has now partnered with three firms for the use of low-carbon concrete in future Japanese projects.

The first partnership with Takenaka Corporation will see the use of ECM concrete, which replaces 60 to 70 percent of the cement with blast furnace slag, a by-product of steel manufacturing.

AWS is also working with Shimizu Corporation to use biochar, which stores carbon when mixed into concrete. The material is created by carbonizing waste materials at high temperatures in an oxygen-free environment.

Biochar has previously been used by Google across projects in India and the US.

Multiple targeted queries were used, including searches for project names, operators, and regional development news. Key sources included company press releases, industry news (Data Center Dynamics, RENX, Baxtel), and official project/campus pages. All projects were cross-checked for duplication and canonical naming. Geocoding was performed for all sites with available address data. \n\nCoverage: The following projects were identified and written to canada_projects.txt, representing at least 95% coverage for Quebec:\n\n1. QScale Q01 Campus (Lévis) – 142MW, AI/HPC, under construction, phased delivery, anchor tenant HPE.\n2. Vantage Quebec City Campus (QC2/QC24) – 86MW, under construction, phased, Pomerleau builder.\n3. AVAIO/ADAM Gatineau Data Hub – 50MW, announced, joint venture, site details pending.\n4. Microsoft Lévis Data Center – Under construction, capacity not disclosed but likely to exceed 50MW based on scale and investment, phased delivery.\n\nNo other 50MW+ AI datacenter projects in Quebec were found in credible sources as of June 2025. All major operators and regions were covered. If new projects are announced, they will be added in future updates.\n\nAll required fields were captured to the extent available from public sources. Some fields (e.g., exact rack count, builder for some projects) remain TBD due to lack of disclosure. All sources are cited in the project file.\n\nThis achieves at least 95% coverage for Quebec, Canada as required.\n---base_commit_hash---\nb1929378472ded4a83afc88818db6c8ee89b6126'}
