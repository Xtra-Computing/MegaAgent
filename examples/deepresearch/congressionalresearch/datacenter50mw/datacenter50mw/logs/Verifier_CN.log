SenseTime AI data center has a total construction area of 130,000 square meters, with 5,000 cabinets built in the first phase, with a design peak computing power of over 3,740 Petaflops (1 Petaflop equals 1 quadrillion floating-point operations per second) and storage of 160pb. It is one of the largest AI data centers in Asia.

In April 2018, SenseTime launched the AI computer prototype development project.

On July 7, 2020, the AI data center started construction in Lingang New Area.

In December 2020, the main structure of the AI data center was completed, and it took only 168 days from the start of construction to the completion.

It took SenseTime merely a year to achieve revenue of 1.2 billion yuan ($170 billion) from generative artificial Intelligence (GAI) despite starting from scratch, and the strategy of developing large AI models and large AI computing infrastructure has played a very important role in the achievement, said the Chinese AI company.

New quality productive forces — a buzz phrase that features high technology, high efficiency and high quality — can be interpreted as great improvements in productivity through enhanced computing capability and algorithms in the AI domain. With that in mind, SenseCore large-scale computing infrastructure is SenseTime's answer to new quality productive forces, said Sheng Shiwei, managing director of the board secretary office with SenseTime.

Content: Hong Kong-based AI company, SenseTime, recently launched one of Asia’s largest artificial intelligence (AI) data centers in Shanghai’s Lin-gang Free Trade Zone.

Spanning a total area of 130,000 square meters and constructed with $880 million worth of investments, the center houses 5,000 computer racks. It is also among the strongest data centers in Asia thanks to its infrastructure with a designed computing capacity of 3.74 exaFLOPS.

The data center’s strongest selling point is its ultra-speed — it can train models with 100 billion parameters, enabling the production of millions of business models for companies in various sectors, particularly, bio-medicine and automotive.

“Industries like bio-medicines and physics need AI to help them explore the next step. We have already cooperated with the National Center for Protein Science to help them in their research and development,” said SenseTime co-founder and vice president, Yang Fan.

Content: ## History

On June 26, 1900, during the Boxer Movement, belligerent European forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at the Battle of Langfang, and were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The Chinese forces were victorious.

It was the site of another battle during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In the summer of 1938, on the vast fertile land on both sides of the Luan River east of Beiping and Tianjin, and west of Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao, an anti Japanese storm swept across the eastern region of Hebei Province - the Jidong People's Anti Japanese Armed Uprising. The Jidong Uprising, in the history of anti fascist armed uprisings during World War II, was the earliest, largest in number, most widespread in territory, had the greatest impact, and achieved the most significant results in the nationwide armed resistance against Japan.... ## Economy

Content: China's ambition to develop AI is underpinned by aggressive investments in computing infrastructure.

According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China's total computing power reached 280 EFLOPS by the end of 2024, with intelligent computing power accounting for 90 EFLOPS, or over 30 percent of the total.

EFLOPS measure the speed of computer systems. It equals 1 quintillion floating-point operations per second.

By 2025, the country aims to boost its aggregate computing capacity to 300 EFLOPS, with AI computing power projected to rise to 35 percent of the total.

This push aligns with a national strategy to position computing power as the "new engine" of the digital economy.

Wu Hequan, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, emphasized that every yuan ($0.139) invested in computing power drives 3 to 4 yuan in GDP growth. "In the global race for AI leadership, expanding computing power supply is critical," he noted.

Content: NetEase Inc. has begun construction of its first large big data center in Gui'an New Area, Guizhou province, Southwest China. The center, located on a 73,000 square meter (109 mu or 7.3 hectare) site in Gui'an New District, will consist of two data computer rooms, comprehensive office buildings, guardhouses, and other facilities, with a planned total building area of 74,000 square meters, including 23,500 square meter for single-building data center. The facility will house 2,300 cabinets with direct ventilation AHUs, primarily supporting 10KW (and some 6KW) power consumption per cabinet.

The first phase of the project was supposed to enter trial operation in September 2023, with the installation of 5,000 data center racks and 40,000 servers. Over the subsequent five years, the center's capacity will be expanded to a total of 10,000 racks and 100,000 servers. The completed center is projected to generate 450 million yuan ($66.7 million) in operating revenue.... |Distance|Site|About|

The Guizhou Big Data Exhibition Center showcases Guizhou's achievements and plans for the big data industry. [Photo/ddcpc website]

The digital economy accounts for 34 percent of the GDP of Southwest China's Guizhou province, which is one of China's eight computing hubs and home to a number of big data center clusters. The growth rate of its digital economy has ranked first nationally for six years in a row.

Guizhou is suitable for the construction of data centers due to its stable geologic structure, cool weather, abundant hydro energy and abundant coal resources.

As air conditioning accounts for nearly half the power costs of data centers, Guizhou's low average summer temperature helps reduce energy consumption, and operation and maintenance costs.

The first and second stages of China Mobile's data center in Guian New Area were put into operation in 2014 and 2019, respectively. The third stage is currently und...

Content: As one of the national data center clusters planned under the "channeling computing resources from the east to the west" project, the data center cluster in Gui'an New Area, Southwest China's Guizhou province, leverages local environmental advantages such as a cool climate, abundant energy resources, and stable geological conditions to attract a total of 20 data (smart computing) centers, giving it among the highest number of large and super-large data centers of any region in the world.

To date, Gui'an has deployed 95,800 smart computing chips, with a computing power scale reaching 30.7 EFLOPS, accounting for 13.3 percent of China's total computing power as of the end of 2023. This scale is equivalent to the computing power output of over 60 million laptop computers.

Gui'an's data center cluster has been looking to coordinate industrial development with environmental protection, forging a green, energy-saving, and low-carbon development path.

会议现场

数据港高级副总裁 宋志刚

**推进“东数西算”枢纽建设，开启战略合作新篇章**

随着云计算、大数据、物联网等新兴应用及技术的蓬勃发展，以数据中心为代表的“新基建”建设进程明显加快，为构建布局合理、供需优化、绿色集约、互联互通的新型算力网络，全面推进“东数西算”刻不容缓。... **数据港怀来数据中心正式运营，打造京津冀算力资源新高地**

张家口怀来县地处首都半小时经济圈，隶属国家“东数西算”京津冀一线核心节点，是推动京津冀协同发展的重要算力枢纽。大部分金融机构、互联网企业聚集于此，数据中心算力需求供不应求。

2020年，数据港与中国联通合作建设的联通怀来大数据创新产业园一期项目正式启动。该项目位于河北省张家口市怀来县，整体占地201亩，规划建筑面积20万平方米，建设标准为国标A级，项目一期计划投运机柜3000架，终期投运机柜达2.3万架。

数据港联通怀来数据中心，将同公司张北、廊坊、北京房山数据中心基地组成京津冀环首都数据中心战略集群，为打造产业算力资源新高地，带动区域数字经济联动，促进周边数字相关产业发展产生积极影响。
