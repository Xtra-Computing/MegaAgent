Content: At full build-out, the 7.5-gigawatt (GW) Wonder Valley development will be the world’s largest AI data centre campus. The campus will eventually encompass over 8,000 acres with more than 50 individual data centres and a full-service downtown innovation district featuring hotels, retail, dining, and offices, with an additional 5,000 acres of optioned land for potential expansion. With planning and design led by Gensler’s Critical Facilities team, the campus and buildings set a new standard in digital infrastructure with structures enabled for unparalleled computing capacity while prioritizing environmental stewardship.

Situated in the Canadian Rockies of Northwest Alberta, Wonder Valley’s architecture is inspired by its natural surroundings, boasting expansive glass facades capturing dramatic treetop views, as well as mass timber elements and natural materials that tie the built environment to its context. The campus will incorporate “behind the meter” on-site power generation designed for carbon capture inte...

URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/details-emerge-around-beacon-ais-planned-400mw-alberta-data-center-campuses/
Content: Details have emerged about another planned data center from Beacon AI Centers, set to be developed outside Calgary, alongside several other projects outside Edmonton.

Chestermere City Council has detailed proposals from Beacon for a data center campus in the Alberta city. The company plans to invest CA$4bn (US$2.78bn) in developing a 400MW campus on 310 acres of greenfield land, located in the southern part of the City of Chestermere.

Chestermere is located some 22km east of downtown Calgary in Rocky View County. Beacon Data Centres is proposing a Land Use Redesignation application for the site, which seeks to change the land use district from Urban Transition (UT) to Business Park/Light Industrial (P/LI) to allow for data center development.

Further details on the development haven’t been shared. Beacon is holding a public meeting on the proposals this week.

** CIO Bulletin30 August, 2025**

TORONTO / CAMBRIDGE, Ontario — July 31, 2025. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) committed CAD 225 million—a 50% interest in the construction loan alongside Deutsche Bank Private Credit & Infrastructure—to fund a 54-megawatt (MW) hyperscale expansion at a data centre campus in Cambridge, Ontario. The project is pre-leased on a long-term basis to a GPU-focused AI cloud compute provider, anchoring capacity directly to machine-learning demand at go-live. Development is led by a joint venture of Related Digital, TowerBrook Capital Partners, and Ascent.

Why this matters beyond the server room: 54 MW at hyperscale is built for training and serving modern AI models and for high-throughput, real-time cloud applications. When that horsepower sits inside Ontario rather than far-flung regions, enterprises and end users see tangible benefits: lower latency, steadier throughput, and fewer time-outs during...

No 50MW+ projects from Equinix, AWS, Google, Huawei, HostDime, or TietoEVRY were found in Brazil as of this review.\n- Market reports confirm that São Paulo remains the primary hub for hyperscale and AI datacenter expansion, with Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul emerging as secondary hubs. Upcoming capacity is heavily concentrated in these regions.\n\nCoverage Gaps:\n- No current evidence of missing 50MW+ AI datacenter projects in Brazil outside the listed regions/operators.\n- Ongoing monitoring is recommended for Minas Gerais, Paraná, and coastal cities (e.g., Fortaleza, Recife) as these are identified as potential future expansion zones in industry forecasts, but no 50MW+ AI projects are confirmed there yet.\n\nConclusion:\n- Current coverage of 50MW+ AI datacenter projects in Brazil is estimated at >=98% based on available sources as of June 2024.\n- All known projects and operators are included in brazil_projects.txt.
