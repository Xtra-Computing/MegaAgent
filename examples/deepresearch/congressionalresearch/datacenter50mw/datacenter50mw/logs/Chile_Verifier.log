Title: Scala Data Centers facility goes live in Curauma, Chile
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/scala-data-centers-facility-goes-live-in-curauma-chile/
Content: Scala Data Centers has launched its first campus in Chile and begun operations at its 5MW data center in Curauma.

The new facility is already fully leased by an anonymous hyperscaler, and is Scala's third data center to be inaugurated this year so far following the company launching additional buildings in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

The facility, named SSCLCR01, is the result of $65 million of investment and 10 months of construction work. While it currently houses 5MW of IT capacity, the data center has the potential to expand up to 30MW in the coming years.

SSCLCR01 is located 56 miles from Chile's capital city, Santiago, in Curauma which is soon to receive the Humboldt subsea cable connecting Latin America to the Asia Pacific.

"In a scenario where 5G accelerates the deployment of various services and applications that use high data volume and require low latency, Scala has succeeded in choosing its first campus to become operational in Chile," Scala's CEO and co-founder Marcos Peigo said.

Content: Microsoft has filed plans for a $317 million data center development in Santiago, Chile.

The company first announced plans for a Chile data center region in December 2020. First spotted by BNAmericas, Microsoft has recently filed its SLC03 project with Chile’s environmental evaluation service (SEA) for an assessment of its feasibility.

Under the plans, the 6.8-hectare site located in the Quilicura area of Santiago will include a single data center building split into two and built over two phases. The first phase of construction is estimated to take 17 months.

“The Project mainly considers the construction and operation of one storage building divided into two units (COLO1 and COLO2) where the technological equipment of the data center and all the necessary infrastructure for its operation will be installed,” the filing states.

The filing adds that the project will include an administration building and 26MWA substation.

Content: Cirion Technologies, a developer of digital infrastructure and technology, plans to construct a 20MW data center in Santiago, Chile. The facility, known as SAN2, will be the company's second data center in the country and is anticipated to be operational by early 2025.

The data center will be located on a 248,000-square-foot site in the Quilicura industrial district of the city, approximately 1.5 miles away from the company's current data center, to which it will be directly connected.

SAN2 will be able to access renewable energy, metropolitan fiber routes, and submarine cable networks due to its location. The data center will be incorporated into Cirion's infrastructure of 18 carrier-neutral data centers across Latin America.

Cirion, backed by the investment group Stonepeak, acquired the land for SAN2 in August 2022 and initially intended to launch the facility in the middle of 2023. In April of this year, the company announced plans for three new data centers in Latin America, including locations in Sant...
