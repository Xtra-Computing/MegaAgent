Posted on:
May 30, 2023

Today, AWS announced the opening of a new AWS Direct Connect location within the Sonda Quilicura Q2 data center in Santiago, Chile. By connecting your network to AWS at the new location, you gain private, direct access to all public AWS Regions (except those in China), AWS GovCloud Regions, and AWS Local Zones.

The new Santiago location offers dedicated 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps connections, with MACsec encryption available for 10 Gbps. Using this new Direct Connect location to reach resources running in the Santiago AWS Local Zone is an ideal solution for applications that require single-digit millisecond latency or local data processing.

The Direct Connect service establishes a private, physical network connection between AWS and your data center, office, or colocation environment. These private connections can provide a more consistent network experience than those made over the public internet.

Content: Microsoft has launched a new cloud region in Chile, its first in the South American country.

The company announced this week that the new Chile Central region, located in the Santiago metropolitan region, is comprised of three independent physical locations - each with one or more data centers - is now operational.

Tito Arciniega, president of Microsoft Latin America, said: “Microsoft’s cloud data center infrastructure in Chile will play a fundamental role in our strategy for Latin America and will help establish a hub that radiates innovation from the region to the world. With Chilean companies integrated into the global economy and exporting goods and services worldwide, this new cloud region will support and stimulate economic growth, allowing businesses and governments to take advantage of the benefits of the cloud.”

Content: Microsoft has filed plans for a $317 million data center development in Santiago, Chile.

The company first announced plans for a Chile data center region in December 2020. First spotted by BNAmericas, Microsoft has recently filed its SLC03 project with Chile’s environmental evaluation service (SEA) for an assessment of its feasibility.

Under the plans, the 6.8-hectare site located in the Quilicura area of Santiago will include a single data center building split into two and built over two phases. The first phase of construction is estimated to take 17 months.

“The Project mainly considers the construction and operation of one storage building divided into two units (COLO1 and COLO2) where the technological equipment of the data center and all the necessary infrastructure for its operation will be installed,” the filing states.

The filing adds that the project will include an administration building and 26MWA substation.
