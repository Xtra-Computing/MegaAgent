Content: Telecommunications giant Bell is tossing its hat into the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure ring as its competitors invest in AI data centres in anticipation of a growing demand for AI compute.

The Bell AI Fabric project aims to build six AI data centres in British Columbia (BC), which the company says make up the first “supercluster” of a planned national network. Bell declined to disclose the value of the project to BetaKit, but said it was in the hundreds of millions (“nine-figure”) range.

American computing hardware company Groq will be providing the chips that power the data centres.

“Bell’s AI Fabric will ensure that Canadian businesses, researchers, and public institutions can access high-performance, sovereign and environmentally responsible AI computing services,” Mirko Bibic, president and CEO of Bell Canada and its parent company BCE, said in a statement.

**Strategy will invest in cutting-edge AI infrastructure and supercharge innovation to strengthen Canada’s AI advantage**

**December 5, 2024** – Ottawa, Ontario

Compute is the technology that powers artificial intelligence (AI). It’s the chips and the data centres, the backbone of this transformative new technology. Access to cutting-edge compute infrastructure is crucial for securing Canada’s AI advantage, empowering researchers and industries to thrive.

Today, the Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, officially launched the Canadian Sovereign AI Compute Strategy. The Strategy will invest up to $2 billion, as previously announced in Budget 2024, to meet three key objectives:

- Up to $700 million to grow Canadian AI champions by leveraging investments in new or expanded data centres through the AI Compute Challenge that is launching today

Content: Canadian telecoms operator Bell Canada has launched 'Bell AI Fabric,' a plan to help build AI data centers across the country.

The new initiative plans to be 'nationwide,' but will start with six data centers in British Columbia, supported by 500MW of hydroelectric power.

The very first facility is set to come online this June, operated by AI inference provider and chip designer Groq. That data center will be a 7MW facility in Kamloops, BC.

“As AI moves into production, nations are rethinking where inference runs and who controls it,” said Jonathan Ross, CEO and founder of Groq. “We’re building infrastructure that’s fast, affordable, and sovereign by design, already powering some of the largest inference deployments in the world.”

Another 7MW data center will open in Merritt, BC, by the end of this year.

Two 26MW data centers at planned for Kamloops, with the first opening later this year at Thompson Rivers University (TRU) and a second coming next year.

June 4, 2025

VANCOUVER – Bell Canada has announced it will open six artificial intelligence data centres in B.C. as part of a plan to create the largest AI compute project in Canada.

The telecom company, which has in recent years publicized its intent to become more tech-focused, said the facilities will provide around 500 megawatts of hydroelectric-powered AI compute capacity.

AI compute refers to the technology that enables artificial intelligence systems to perform tasks, such as processing data and training machine-learning models.

The project, called Bell AI Fabric, will help support Canadian businesses and governments’ AI needs, ranging from strategy and applications development to infrastructure deployment, the company said.

Bell AI Fabric’s first seven-megawatt data centre is slated to open next month in Kamloops, in partnership with American AI inference provider Groq.
