Meta Platforms is planning to build a significant data center in northern Louisiana, specifically in Richland Parish. This project, known as "Project Sucre," will be situated on 2,250 acres of agricultural land, approximately 125 miles east of Shreveport. The data center campus represents a substantial investment, with capital expenditures estimated between $5 billion and $10 billion.

To support the energy needs of this massive facility, Entergy, the local energy provider, has filed an application to build 2.23 GW of natural gas capacity. This includes a new gas plant planned to be constructed adjacent to the data center site.

This project underscores Louisiana's growing appeal as a location for large-scale data centers, driven by its available land, energy resources, and recent legislative incentives for data center investme...

Title: Meta announces 4 million sq ft, 2GW Louisiana data center campus
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/meta-announces-4-million-sq-ft-louisiana-data-center-campus/
Content: Social media giant Meta has confirmed plans to build a data center in Louisiana.

The company this week announced a $10 billion development in Richland Parish, northeast Louisiana.

“We are excited to announce that Richland Parish, Louisiana, will be home to Meta’s newest data center — our 23rd data center in the United States and 27th in the world,” the company said on Facebook. “This custom-designed four million-square-foot campus will be our largest data center to date. It will play a vital role in accelerating our AI progress.”

Set on the 2,250 acres former Franklin Farm megasite between the municipalities of Rayville and Delhi, about 30 miles east of Monroe, the campus will total more than 4 million sq ft (371,610 sqm). Renderings suggest up to nine buildings are planned. Meta expects site work to begin in December, with construction to continue through 2030.

In an Instagram post, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the site would total more than 2GW at full build-out and would be used to train its Llama AI ...

Content: Deep in Central Ohio, in the tech-forward suburb of New Albany, Meta’s Prometheus Campus is becoming ground zero for the future of AI infrastructure deployment.

What started as a traditional hyperscale complex of five H-shaped data centers is now evolving into a radically different buildout—with

**tent-like structures replacing concrete shells, and timelines measured in months, not years.**

In Q1 2024, Meta broke from its previous design by beginning construction on

**two new AI-optimized buildings**, tailored to support high-density compute for training large models. But in mid-2025, satellite imagery and executive comments confirmed something even more ambitious: a **completely reimagined build strategy** that reduces both structural complexity and time-to-activation.

“We pioneered this new method where we’re basically building up these weatherproof tents and building out the networks and the GPU clusters inside them in order to build them faster. They are hurricane-proof tents.”

Content: **The Blueprint**

MOUNT PLEASANT, Wis. — A tech giant’s footprint will expand in Racine County.

Microsoft on Thursday announced it will build a $4 billion advanced artificial intelligence data center in Mount Pleasant over the next three years, which will be similar in size and scale to the initial $3.3 billion facility set to be operational in 2026. The company’s total Wisconsin investment has reached roughly $7.3 billion.

“We’re in the final phases of building Fairwater, the world’s most powerful AI data center in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin — part of a region forged by generations of hard work and ingenuity,” wrote Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft, in an announcement.

In May 2024, Microsoft announced its first data center complex in southeastern Wisconsin, which included a visit from former President Joe Biden. The company initially planned a 1.5 million-square-foot data center on land formerly set aside for Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Group.

Foxconn’s plans didn’t come to fruition,...

Content: Amazon will invest at least $20 billion in cloud computing and AI across Pennsylvania, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced today.

The new plan aims to create at least 1,250 high-paying tech jobs, according to Shapiro. The first two “innovation campuses” will employ workers in building, maintaining and operating local data centers.

The **Susquehanna Steam Electric Station** is a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania. Susquehanna is capable of generating enough power to provide more than two million homes with electricity. Susquehanna also supplies energy to an adjacent data center campus. It is located near the Susquehanna River in Salem Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.

## Operations

Susquehanna Station Nuclear, a division of Talen Energy, serves as 90% owner and operator of the 2.5-gigawatt Susquehanna Steam Electric Station. PPL operated the plant until June 2015 when Talen Energy was formed from PPL's competitive supply business. The plant has two General Electric boiling water reactors within a Mark II containment building on a site of 1,075 acres (435 ha), with approximately 900 employees working on site and additional support employees in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Harrisburg-based Allegheny Electric Cooperative purchased 10% of the plant in 1977.

URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/aws-granted-1600-acre-rezoning-request-plans-15-building-campus-at-pennsylvania-nuclear-site/
Content: Amazon is planning a large data center campus next to a nuclear power station in Pennsylvania.

First reported by the Citizen Voice, Salem Township Supervisors this week voted 3-0 to rezone nearly 1,600 acres of land into a new industrial “Special Data Center Overlay District.”

Amazon officials said the company hopes to construct 15 data center buildings over the course of the next decade.

Amazon acquired a data center and land in Salem Township, Luzerne County, in March. The existing facility is powered by nuclear energy from Talen Energy’s adjacent Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (SSES).

Most of the rezoned land was previously zoned as agricultural; much of it is located between the Susquehanna nuclear power plant and the Caithness Moxie Freedom natural gas power plant along Mingle Inn Road.

The township’s Planning Commission previously recommended supervisors approve Amazon’s request. The Luzerne County Planning Commission offered no opinion on the plans.

The data center will be located at the Hunt Midwest Business Center.

The cloud giant first purchased 78.9 acres in Northland, Kansas City, in 2019, followed by another 236.4 acres in December 2021, at the time stating that it was for a "potential data center." Moves on the project began to be made in September 2023, when Google filed planning applications.

In October, Google shared that the data center campus will be developed over four phases and feature several ancillary buildings for a total of 1.435 million sq ft (133,316 sqm) of floor space.

According to Monique Picou, global vice president of cloud supply chain and operations, the company's continued investment in technical infrastructure such as data centers is the "backbone" for supporting its AI innovations and business growth.

Meta Platforms is planning to build a significant data center in northern Louisiana, specifically in Richland Parish. This project, known as "Project Sucre," will be situated on 2,250 acres of agricultural land, approximately 125 miles east of Shreveport. The data center campus represents a substantial investment, with capital expenditures estimated between $5 billion and $10 billion.

To support the energy needs of this massive facility, Entergy, the local energy provider, has filed an application to build 2.23 GW of natural gas capacity. This includes a new gas plant planned to be constructed adjacent to the data center site.

This project underscores Louisiana's growing appeal as a location for large-scale data centers, driven by its available land, energy resources, and recent legislative incentives for data center investme...

Meta Platforms is planning to build a significant data center in northern Louisiana, specifically in Richland Parish. This project, known as "Project Sucre," will be situated on 2,250 acres of agricultural land, approximately 125 miles east of Shreveport. The data center campus represents a substantial investment, with capital expenditures estimated between $5 billion and $10 billion.

To support the energy needs of this massive facility, Entergy, the local energy provider, has filed an application to build 2.23 GW of natural gas capacity. This includes a new gas plant planned to be constructed adjacent to the data center site.

This project underscores Louisiana's growing appeal as a location for large-scale data centers, driven by its available land, energy resources, and recent legislative incentives for data center investme...

URL: https://www.aterio.io/blog/inside-meta-s-prometheus-campus-shift
Content: Deep in Central Ohio, in the tech-forward suburb of New Albany, Meta’s Prometheus Campus is becoming ground zero for the future of AI infrastructure deployment.

What started as a traditional hyperscale complex of five H-shaped data centers is now evolving into a radically different buildout—with

**tent-like structures replacing concrete shells, and timelines measured in months, not years.**

In Q1 2024, Meta broke from its previous design by beginning construction on

**two new AI-optimized buildings**, tailored to support high-density compute for training large models. But in mid-2025, satellite imagery and executive comments confirmed something even more ambitious: a **completely reimagined build strategy** that reduces both structural complexity and time-to-activation.

“We pioneered this new method where we’re basically building up these weatherproof tents and building out the networks and the GPU clusters inside them in order to build them faster. They are hurricane-proof tents.”

New Albany is located in the northeastern Franklin County with a portion extending east into the Licking County. It is northeast of Columbus at an elevation of 1,024 feet (312 m).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 15.4 square miles (39.8 km^2^), of which 15.2 square miles (39.4 km^2^) are land and 0.15 square miles (0.4 km^2^), or 1.09%, are water.

New Albany is situated in the headwaters of the Rocky Fork, a tributary of Big Walnut Creek. The tributaries of Rocky Fork, Rose Run and Sugar Run, flow northeast to southwest throughout the city. Blacklick Creek flows through the eastern end of the city.

### Neighborhoods

Three main roads intersect the city center: Dublin-Granville, U.S. Route 62/Johnstown Road, and New Albany-Reynoldsburg/Ohio Route 605/New Albany-Condit. These three roads divide the city into six roughly equal sections. In the southwest section is the New Albany Country Club, much of the club's golf course (designed by Jack Nicklaus),...

Content: In the heart of the American Midwest, a modern marvel is rising. We’re in the final phases of building Fairwater, the world’s most powerful AI datacenter in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin — part of a region forged by generations of hard work and ingenuity. This facility is more than a technological feat. It’s a promise to grow responsibly, invest deeply, and create opportunities for Wisconsin and for the nation.

We are on track to complete construction and bring this AI datacenter online in early 2026, fulfilling our initial $3.3 billion investment pledge. We’ve already begun hiring full-time employees to support its operation.

And we’re not done. Today, we’re committing an additional $4 billion to be spent in the next three years to build our second datacenter of similar size and scale — bringing our total investment in Wisconsin to more than $7 billion.

Content: **The Blueprint**

MOUNT PLEASANT, Wis. — A tech giant’s footprint will expand in Racine County.

Microsoft on Thursday announced it will build a $4 billion advanced artificial intelligence data center in Mount Pleasant over the next three years, which will be similar in size and scale to the initial $3.3 billion facility set to be operational in 2026. The company’s total Wisconsin investment has reached roughly $7.3 billion.

“We’re in the final phases of building Fairwater, the world’s most powerful AI data center in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin — part of a region forged by generations of hard work and ingenuity,” wrote Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft, in an announcement.

In May 2024, Microsoft announced its first data center complex in southeastern Wisconsin, which included a visit from former President Joe Biden. The company initially planned a 1.5 million-square-foot data center on land formerly set aside for Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Group.

Foxconn’s plans didn’t come to fruition,...

Title: CoreWeave plans $6bn data center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/coreweave-plans-6bn-data-center-in-lancaster-pennsylvania/
Content: AI cloud firm CoreWeave has revealed plans to invest up to $6 billion in developing a data center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

The data center will have an initial 100MW of IT capacity, though it will have the potential to scale up to 300MW, and will be "purpose-built" for AI use cases.

GPU cloud provider CoreWeave will be the sole tenant of the site, with the data center to be co-developed by Chirisa Technology Parks and Machine Investment Group.

Around 600 skilled jobs are expected to be needed during the build phase, and around 70 full-time technical and operational roles at launch, scaling to 175 over time.

The size of the data center, and its exact planned location, have not been shared. However, in February 2025, Machine Investment Group purchased two former printing press facilities in Lancaster. It was said at the time that the two separate locations, totaling more than two million square feet (185,806 sqm) across 144 acres in Lancaster County, were set to be redeveloped into data centers focused o...
