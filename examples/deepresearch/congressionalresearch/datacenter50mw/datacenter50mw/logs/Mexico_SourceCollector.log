Content: Latin American data center firm OData has launched the first phase of a new campus in Querétaro, Mexico.

The Aligned-owned firm this week announced the launch of the first 75MW facility at its DC QR03 campus, located in the PyME Industrial Park in Querétaro.

At full build-out, the campus will see an investment of more than $3 billion and provide up to 300MW of IT capacity across five buildings, totaling around 275,000 sqm (2,960,075 sq ft).

“With three anchor hyperscale clients already committed, QR03 is an established, highly connected campus and a critical interconnection hub for Querétaro and Mexico,” said Ricardo Alário, CEO of OData. “With abundant power and a strong presence of major cloud and AI providers, we anticipate this campus will play a central role in the development of Mexico’s digital infrastructure.”

OData is introducing Aligned’s proprietary Delta Cube (Delta³) cooling solution to the Mexican market for the first time. Designed to support power densities of up to 50kW per rack, the comp...

ODATA, an Aligned Data Centers company and a leader in LATAM data centre construction and operations, is expanding critical substation and transmission infrastructure near its DC QR03 data centre campus – solving the data centre energy scarcity in Querétaro, Mexico.

The expansion establishes ODATA as the main provider in the country with the robust infrastructure required to support large and hyperscale cloud computing and AI deployments. The development is essential for the advancement of the country’s digital economy.

In partnership with Ammper, Mexican multinational company focused on the energy transition and a leader in renewable energy supply, ODATA successfully energised 200 MW in the first phase of the energy project earlier this quarter. The energisation addresses a critical constraint on Mexico’s data centres: the grid’s historical lag in meeting technological demand.

by Elizabeth Fuentes on 14 JAN 2025 in

In February 2024, we announced plans to expand Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure in Mexico. Today, I’m excited to announce the general availability of the AWS Mexico (Central) Region with three Availability Zones and API code **mx-central-1**. This new AWS Region is the first AWS infrastructure Region in Mexico and adds to our growing presence in Latin America.

The AWS Region in Mexico represents a significant commitment to the country’s digital future. AWS is planning to invest more than $5 billion in Mexico over 15 years. This AWS Region will provide customers with advanced and secure cloud technologies, including cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities with purpose-built processors, while supporting Mexico’s growing digital economy. With this effort, AWS will support an average of more than 7,000 full-time equivalent jobs annually in Mexico, adding more than $10 billion to Mexi...

Dubbed the AWS Mexico (Central) Region, it forms part of AWS' commitment to invest more than $5 billion in Mexico over 15 years and went live on January 14.

“This launch marks a significant step as we continue to expand our infrastructure and deliver global innovation in machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and other advanced technologies for our customers,” said Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice president of Infrastructure Services at AWS.

“With access to secure and reliable infrastructure, along with a broad set of AWS technologies, this new AWS Region will help businesses across Mexico sit at the center of AI and ML innovation. We’re proud to deepen our investment in Mexico to help support business transformation, foster technology talent, build cloud skills, and create opportunities for economic growth.”

The region has three Availability Zones in Queretaro, distanced so as to maintain redundancy with low latency.

As winter maintains its hold over where I live in the Netherlands, rare moments of sunlight become precious gifts. This weekend offered one such treasure—while cycling along a quiet canal, golden rays broke through the typically gray Dutch sky, creating a perfect moment of serenity. These glimpses of brightness feel particularly special during January, when daylight can be scarce in our corner of Europe. As we move deeper into 2025, the third week of the new year brings both reflection and forward momentum. While global conversations swirl around technological advancements, it’s these small, personal moments that remind us to pause and appreciate the simple pleasures among our rapidly evolving world.

Let’s look at the last week’s new announcements.

Content: Amazon Web Services (AWS) has announced that its new data center in Queretaro, Mexico, will begin operations in 2025. This center aims to establish itself as a key technology hub for the Americas by offering over 240 cloud services.

In February of this year, AWS announced the creation of a new region in Mexico, with a projected investment of over US$5 billion over the next 15 years, as previously reported by MBN.

The new region will consist of three availability zones, adding to AWS' 105 global availability zones. This development is intended to provide developers, businesses, and organizations in Mexico with additional options for running applications and serving end users with reduced latency and increased data security.

Rubén Mugártegui, general manager, AWS in Mexico, stated in a publication on X that the data center is 100% built and currently in the final stages of testing.

AWS has implemented a cooling approach that significantly reduces water usage, addressing one of the common sustainability chal...

URL: https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/aws-pledges-to-spend-5b-in-mexico-launches-new-mexico-server-region/
Content: In an announcement Tuesday, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon’s cloud computing division, said it plans to invest $5 billion in Mexico over the next 15 years as a part of a “long-term commitment” in the region.

A portion of that investment is a new server region launching today, AWS Mexico (Central) Region, that will allow AWS customers to run applications and serve end users from AWS data centers located in Mexico. AWS estimates that construction and ongoing operation of AWS Mexico will add approximately $10 billion to Mexico’s GDP and support roughly 7,000 “full time equivalent jobs.”

To be clear, AWS won’t be hiring ~7,000 new Mexico-based staff. Rather, the company is anticipating that “external businesses” within the “AWS supply chain in Mexico,” like construction and telecommunications firms, will create these jobs.

That may turn out to be an optimistic estimate. Data center projects often create fewer jobs than promised.
