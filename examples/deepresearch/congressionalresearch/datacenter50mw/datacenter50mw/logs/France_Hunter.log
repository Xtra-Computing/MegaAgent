Content: # France Attracts Major Data Center Investment: A Legal Framework OverviewMay 27, 2025

Several major data center projects were announced at this year’s “Choose France” summit, which comes on the heels of the announcement of a €109 billion investment at the 2025 Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris. While this highlights the nation’s allure for establishing data centers, stakeholders should be prepared for compliance with certain French regulations.

France's appeal as a location for data center projects is clear, particularly given its readily available, inexpensive, and carbon-free electricity. The nation’s strategy of massive investment in artificial intelligence (AI) is promising for players in the sector; however, they still need to anticipate obtaining a number of administrative authorizations, particularly regarding national environmental and urban planning regulations.... ### ENVIRONMENTAL LAW

URL: https://www.bebeez.eu/2025/09/11/vive-la-revolution-the-inside-story-of-the-big-french-ai-data-center-build-out/
Content: In the grounds of Château de Bruyères-le-Châtel, a 19th-century castle located southwest of France’s capital city, Paris, sits a collection of buildings known as La Lisiere.

Since 2015, La Lisiere (which roughly translates to The Edge) has provided a low-cost space for exhibitions and performances, as well as a retreat for artists looking for somewhere quiet and reflective to stay while they get their creative juices flowing.

It is somewhat ironic, then, that less than 100 meters away from La Lisiere, a new data center is rising that will host one of the AI systems considered by many to present an existential threat to the creative industries.

The data center, being built on an adjacent plot by a new French operator, Eclairion, will host the first dedicated cluster of GPUs for Mistral, developer of the Le Chat chatbot and the company often lauded as Europe’s best home-grown hope of challenging the big US AI labs such as OpenAI and Anthropic.

Title: Data4 to invest €100m in Paris campus after bumper quarter
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/data4-to-invest-100m-in-paris-campus-after-bumper-quarter/
Content: France-based data center provider Data4 has expanded in its 110-hectare campus near Paris, with a record-breaking 6MW sold in three months. The company plans to build another three data centers, costing €100m (currently $110m) on the site before the end of 2017.

The space has mostly been taking by French tech firms and Fortune 100 players, wanting hybrid cloud, with a mixture of service providers and end users taking the capacity, Data4’s chief commercial officer Adam Levine told

*DatacenterDynamics. *The news marks a return to growth for the Paris colocation market, which only added 2MW during the whole of 2015, he said.... ## Paris boosted

“The Paris market has been a bit flat,” said Levine. With only around 127MW in total, it’s about one third the size of London, but has a lot of potential. The 6MW predates the UK’s vote to leave the European Union, but the possibility of Brexit could be a boost for the site, he said.

Title: OVHcloud launches multi-zone cloud region in Paris, France
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/ovhcloud-launches-multi-zone-cloud-region-in-paris-france/
Content: European cloud provider OVHcloud has launched a new cloud region in Paris, France.

The company said its 3-AZ Paris region spans three data centers, located approximately 30km apart, to provide organizations with resilience and low latency.

In this new region, the company said data can be replicated for near-instant failover or distributed for scale. OVH previously came under criticism for putting backups in the same data center in the wake of a fire at its Strasbourg site.

The company said that deployment is available immediately and will typically involve the roll-out of a minimum of three bare metal servers in its three Paris-based data centers.

Bare metal servers are the first service to become available in the 3-AZ Paris region. However, OVH said its other products and solutions, such as compute, AI, quantum, and storage, will soon be available.

OVH chief product and technology officer, Yaniv Fdida, said: “This launch is an important step in our public cloud strategy. We are really proud of this new ...

Content: ## Net Absorption

### North America

Net absorption in the top four North American markets surged 101% year-over-year in Q1 to 1,668.5 MW, driven by continued strong demand in Northern Virginia and increased activity in Phoenix and Atlanta. Absorption was primarily driven by hyperscale expansion and new power availability across key submarkets, particularly in Atlanta’s booming metro area.

### Europe

Net absorption among the top four European markets increased by 300.5 MW in Q1, down from an increase of 487.6 MW a year earlier. Demand easily outstripped new supply. Frankfurt and Paris accounted for most of the demand, both buoyed by new hyperscale and AI requirements.

### Asia-Pacific

Asia-Pacific leasing demand remained stable in Q1, driven primarily by enterprise colocation and cloud services adoption. Demand from the AI segment is also contributing to absorption both for training workloads and larger IT capacity deployments. Major markets such as Tokyo and Sydney and secondary markets such as Osaka, M...

Title: France Data Center Construction Market Size and Share
URL: https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/france-data-center-construction-market
Content: ## Segment Analysis

Tier 3 halls retained 52.7% of France data center construction market share in 2024 because most enterprise applications require high but not fault-tolerant uptime. The France data center construction market size for Tier 3 builds is forecast to continue expanding steadily yet below the overall industry CAGR. Tier 4, by contrast, is projected to grow 8.2% annually through 2030 as AI model training, fintech clearing and critical national infrastructure workloads need 99.995% availability.

Tier 4 projects entail 2N power trains, dual fibre paths and concurrent maintainability across mechanical subsystems, prompting larger electrical rooms and more sophisticated building-management software. The Thésée DataCenter campus, recognised as the nation’s first Uptime Tier IV colocation site, integrates AI-based cooling optimisation that trims energy consumption without compromising redundancy. Suppliers are therefore seeing heightened demand for AI-driven environmental controls, arc-flash-resistan...

Content: #### Takeaways for Hyperscale Data Centers

Different types of data centers serve different roles within the architecture of a hyperscale customer like Amazon Web Services. Large footprint “hyperscale” data centers within “Availability Zones” (depicted as the dark blue boxes above) are needed to house scaled deployments of servers and other equipment. These “hyperscale” facilities may be situated in less expensive locations – in terms of land, power, and taxes – often referred to as “compute” or “storage” nodes.

Hyperscale companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google Cloud typically lease space on a wholesale basis

**OR** build their own data centers to meet these “compute” or “storage” requirements. Digital Realty, CyrusOne and QTS typically serve as the “compute” or “storage” nodes, which represent the hyperscale facilities.

Smaller deployments also need to be in connectivity-rich locations. This enables different “Regions” to send traffic among one another within a cloud platform, or as a l...

Content: ## Americas

Power availability remains the top consideration for data center developers, with operators in the Americas seeking two- to three-year delivery timelines but often facing delays of five years or more. Where utility providers can’t provide power sooner, some operators have partnered with power companies to build substations, transmission lines, or to tap into microgrid power. Growing demand for large-scale power, abundant land and relaxed latency requirements for AI has also driven hyperscalers and operators to expand into historically peripheral markets like Indianapolis, Kansas City and the Carolinas. While these emerging markets have been gaining traction, they still trail established markets in development pipelines.
