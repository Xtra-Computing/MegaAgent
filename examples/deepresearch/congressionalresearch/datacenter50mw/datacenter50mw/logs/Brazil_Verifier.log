**What’s Involved in the Transition**

Repurposing a mining farm into a data center involves:



**Redesigning airflow and cooling systems**to support traditional or AI server racks



**Upgrading network infrastructure**for higher-speed fiber and cloud on-ramps



**Adding security and compliance layers**(e.g., access controls, monitoring, SOC 2 standards)



**Segmenting power feeds**for tenant control or colocation deployment

Some operators are using modular designs to retrofit specific sections of the facility for new use cases without shutting down crypto operations entirely.

**Who’s Leading the Shift**



**Compute North**and **Core Scientific**are diversifying into broader compute services.



**HIVE Blockchain**is expanding into AI and HPC hosting.



**Bitmain and Hut 8**have introduced colocation services for Web3 and edge workloads.

Content: In the race for digital dominance, land isn’t just a foundation—it’s a frontier.

**Land Is the New Bandwidth**

The digital economy is surging—and it’s not slowing down. Artificial intelligence, cloud computing, video streaming, IoT, and blockchain are driving exponential growth in data. But all that digital horsepower still needs a physical home. That’s why in 2025, land for data centers isn’t just real estate—it’s infrastructure strategy.

For developers, hyperscalers, colocation providers, and investors alike, the question isn’t if to acquire land, but where, how fast, and how much. As land markets tighten and development hurdles grow, securing the right parcel can offer a massive edge—or become a costly bottleneck.

This blog unpacks the key land acquisition trends shaping the future of data centers in 2025: where demand is shifting, what site selectors prioritize, and how developers are navigating power, policy, and pricing.

Content: [2]Swinhoe, Dan, “Microsoft to Invest $2.7 Billion in Cloud and AI Infrastructure in Brazil,” datacenterdynamics.com Hyperscalers partner with local operators, such as Ascenty and Scala, to navigate licensing, grid interconnection, and environmental regulations, thereby compressing construction timelines. Hyperscale footprints are adding power at a 10.1% CAGR, outpacing the broader Brazil data center market, as firms seek scalable, cloud-integrated solutions over traditional retail colocation. The trend is anchored in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, while radiating to cooler southern states where land and renewable power are cost-competitive. Wholesale leasing models grow in tandem, enabling enterprises to offset capex while maintaining control of high-density racks.

*Backed by abundant renewable energy and strategic subsea connectivity, Brazil is gearing up for a data center boom. Despite the sector’s optimism, Infralogic’s Gabriela Valente investigates the challenges and hurdles to unlock investments in hyperscale facilities *

Brazil’s digital infrastructure market is expected to undergo a data center revolution, with BRL 2trn (USD 358bn) in projected investments over the next decade, according to the federal government. The country aims to position itself as Latin America’s premier hub for hyperscale data centers tailored to artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. But while the promise is immense, so are the challenges — from tax burdens and power grid constraints to regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical considerations.

Brazil’s appeal lies in a unique combination of factors: Almost 90% of Brazil’s electricity comes from renewable sources, according to power regulator ANEEL, which aligns with hyperscalers’ net-zero goals and ...

A surveu by CBRE, obtained exclusively by NeoFeed, predicts a jump in local industry capacity, benefiting issues such as energy and location.

*Of the 340MW of growth forecast for this year in Latin America, around 220MW will come from Brazil.*

At a time when the world is witnessing the accelerated growth of artificial intelligence (AI) , with the prediction that big techs will invest hundreds of billions of dollars per year to be at the forefront of this issue, Brazil has been identified as the new frontier for an important element in this race: data centers.

The growing digitalization of the population and companies and the issue of land availability and abundant clean energy make the country a fertile territory for investments in data centers, which can grow even more with AI.

A survey carried out by real estate consultancy CBRE, whose main data were exclusively released to NeoFeed , shows that the Latin Ame...

Content: ## Brazil: The digital transformation and AI leader for Latin America

The Brazilian government’s investments in digital transformation and AI have resulted in a steadily growing digital economy. In 2021, the Brazilian AI Strategy (EBIA) was launched, followed by the National Plan for AI in 2024, allocating $4 billion USD of investment in AI infrastructure and development.[4] More recently, the Brazilian government is preparing to launch a new data center framework to attract more investment to Brazil and expand the country’s digital infrastructure. The National Data Center Policy, scheduled to be launched in May 2025, should provide tax incentives, legal security and specific rules for the sector.[5] As a result of these initiatives, Brazil now serves as an entry point for major clouds and digital technologies coming into Latin America.

Content: As of mid-2024, São Paulo, the largest data center market, had a capacity of 330.0MW(Cushman & Wakefield, 2024). It alone accounts for 67.0% of the total data center inventory among the top four countries in the LATAM region (CBRE, 2024). As Brazil’s primary commercial hub, São Paulo acts as a strategic gateway to other Latin American markets of Argentina, Chile and Uruguay as well as the United States. Its advanced digital infrastructure, comprising multiple submarine cable landing stations, high-speed internet connectivity and an extensive telecom network, has been a key growth enabler for the data center market. The Campinas region in the São Paulo state is the largest data center hub in Brazil, leading in terms of both operational capacity and ongoing or planned construction of projects (Bnamericas, 2024). However, space and energy constraints are pushing new developments further from the market’s core. Certain areas in Barueri and Osasco have gained attention for smaller-scale data center projects due to...
