Content: # Deutsche Telekom to Build AI Data Centre with SAP and Others

A consortium of German companies, including Deutsche Telekom, SAP and Ionos, are looking to develop an AI data centre with the European Commission’s AI gigafactories initiative.

First reported by Handelsblatt, Deutsche Telekom has partnered with SAP, web hosting company Ionos and Schwarz to seek support from the European Union (EU) to build a data centre specifically for AI in Germany.

This comes in the wake of the European Commission unveiling plans to offer €20bn ($20.9bn) in funding to build AI data centres in order for Europe to remain competitive with the US and China.

Handelsblatt reported on Tuesday that the consortium of companies are forming plans to build one of these five centres, also known as gigafactories, that the EU will support.

“The window of opportunity to create our own independent infrastructure for this is now,” Christine Knackfuss-Nicolic, Chief Technology Officer of Deutsche Telekom's T-Systems division, tells Reuters....

The increasing relevance and ubiquity of technologies such as AI, Machine Learning, 5G and Cloud services leads to

**growing demand for data centers**. And they will be needed soon since the amount of data transported will continue to grow significantly. The International Data Corporation (IDC) predicts that the annual volume of transported data will reach up to 284 zettabytes (ZB) by 2027. To put this into perspective, one zettabyte is approximately equivalent to a 500,000,000,000 hours long high-definition movie.

This continuously increasing volume of data needs to be addressed with new, larger, and more powerful data centers. Today, Germany plays a crucial role in the European market, with Frankfurt being the second most important location on the continent and Berlin currently experiencing tremendous growth. While ...

Analysts’ forecasts of hundreds of billions in data center investment are materializing, with Microsoft planning an $80 billion buildout in 2025.

The company said the funds would be used to create new data centers, mainly in the US but also further afield, underscoring the intense capital requirements of AI systems.

More than half of this projected spending through June 2025 will be in the US, Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a New Year blog post. Recent AI progress is thanks to “large-scale infrastructure investments that serve as the essential foundation of AI innovation and use,” Smith wrote.

While the news was welcomed by many as an indication of things to come in 2025, it was tempered by the announcement that Microsoft had paused construction of portions of its multibillion-dollar data center campus in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin. The tech giant received approval for the campus in November 2023.
