Content: ## Strategic location as a data centre hub

Australia is the ideal location to build green data centres to power Asia’s digital transformation. Australia has 17 subsea cables to Asia and the world. More are being built.

- Services to Asia: Australia can back up data storage and processing facilities for customers in Asia.

- Competitive power costs: Average industrial energy prices are low in Australia – compared to hubs in Asia, including Singapore.

- Incentives for green data centres: The Australian Government helps fund new green data centres.

Western Australia and the Northern Territory are likely to emerge as suppliers of data centre services to Asia. This is due to proximity, existing undersea cables and a shared time zone.

Title: State significant development warehouses and data centres
URL: https://www.planning.nsw.gov.au/policy-and-legislation/planning-reforms/ssd-warehouses-and-data-centres
Content: In June 2021 the State and Regional Development SEPP was amended to temporarily allow more warehouses and data centres to be assessed as state significant development (SSD).

Following this change, a new definition for data centres was introduced into the Local Environmental Plan Standard Instrument, State Environmental Planning Policy (Planning Systems) 2021 and State Environmental Planning Policy (Transport and Infrastructure) 2021. It is considered a type of high-technology industry.

These changes provide clearer, more streamlined and more certain planning pathways for warehouses and data centres.

## Why focus on warehouses and data centres?

Warehouses and data centres are well placed to support the state’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The demand for data centres and warehouse development is growing due to rapid technology advancements and a boom in e-commerce sectors. This is coupled with a need for larger off-site data storage and a shift to keeping business locally within NSW.

Content: Co-authored by Solicitor, Jake Meyers

The growing demand for data centres is well documented. According to the Property Council of Australia, Australia’s data market is projected to “reach a value of AU$9.49 billion by 2028”.

To this end, the NSW Government has recognised the significance of the data centre market in state planning provisions. Data centres are recognised as State significant development (SSD) in the State Environmental Planning Policy (Planning Systems) 2021 (Planning System SEPP). So, approval for the construction and operation of data centres can be secured through the streamlined SSD approval process. However, this planning pathway is not without its hurdles.

Data centres which do not meet the criteria for SSD must be assessed and determined by the local council. This is often a longer process and can result in further issues being raised.

Data centres are only permissible with development consent on land zoned:

Regrettably, the NSW State Government has recently imposed a prohibition ...

Content: Co-authored by Jett Lobb, Solicitor, Energy, Infrastructure and Major Projects

Australia’s data centre sector is booming, driven by AI and digital growth - but so too are the energy and regulatory challenges.

With electricity demand from data centres forecast to increase significantly by 2030, developers, suppliers, contractors, investors and operators face a shifting landscape of technical standards, sustainability targets and connection hurdles.

From the new 5-star NABERS requirement for federal workloads to grid rule reforms, battery co-location models and blackout risk management planning - the regulatory and commercial stakes are rising fast. In this article, we unpack what is changing, where the risks are and how to position strategically.

Australia is experiencing a rapid expansion of data centres, driven by cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and digital services. This growth is energy intensive - data centres consumed about 5% of Australia’s electricity in 2024, and that share is forecast t...

Australia is the ideal location to build green data centres to power Asia’s digital transformation. Australia has 17 subsea cables to Asia and the world. More are being built.

- Services to Asia: Australia can back up data storage and processing facilities for customers in Asia.

- Competitive power costs: Average industrial energy prices are low in Australia – compared to hubs in Asia, including Singapore.

- Incentives for green data centres: The Australian Government helps fund new green data centres.

Western Australia and the Northern Territory are likely to emerge as suppliers of data centre services to Asia. This is due to proximity, existing undersea cables and a shared time zone.

### Published on April 4, 2024,... ### by

In a significant move towards sustainability and energy efficiency, the Australian Federal Government is poised to tighten the energy efficiency regulations for data centres hosting federal agency workloads.

*, these changes will mandate all data centre service providers to the government to achieve a five-star rating from the National Australian Built Environment Rating System (NABERS). Starting mid-2025*

Historically, the five-star NABERS requirement was limited to data centre providers listed on the new data centre panel established by the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) data centre panel in May. This directive will expand beyond the panel from July 1, 2025, encompassing all facilities, irrespective of whether they are contracted from external companies or operated by the government.

Content: The New South Wales Government has changed planning rules in order to fast track data center planning applications in Southwest Australia.

The NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment has lowered the threshold for them to be assessed as State Significant Development (SSD); for the next two years until 31 May 2023, the threshold to be assessed as an SSD will be lowered from AU$50 million (US$38.9 million) to AU$30 million ($23.3 million). The number of planning assessment officers would also be increased to help manage the demand.

## New South Wales wants data center projects

SSDs are classed as having ‘State significance’ due to the size, economic value or potential impacts that a development may have. Such projects are assessed by the NSW Government, rather than at the local level, which the Government says provides a ‘clear and more certain planning pathway.'

According to the Property Council of Australia, Australia’s data market is projected to “reach a value of AU$9.49 billion by 2028”.\n\nTo this end, the NSW Government has recognised the significance of the data centre market in state planning provisions. Data centres are recognised as State significant development (SSD) in the State Environmental Planning Policy (Planning Systems) 2021 (Planning System SEPP). So, approval for the construction and operation of data centres can be secured through the streamlined SSD approval process. However, this planning pathway is not without its hurdles.\n\nData centres which do not meet the criteria for SSD must be assessed and determined by the local council.

Content: The US government has had a bit of a tumultuous relationship with, well, most of the world around the export of chips, thanks to the exponential growth of AI and the uncertainty of tariffs. Large datacentres need technology to keep growing, and America clearly wants to sit at the top of the AI pile. The United Arab Emirates may just sit on that pile alongside it, according to recent agreements.
As reported by Bloomberg, the US and the United Arab Emirates have reached an accord for the UAE to start taking in Nvidia processors for AI development. The Commerce Department Bureau of Industry and Security reportedly issued a license to Nvidia to export chips, but the specific number of processors has not yet been announced.
The US was previously in talks to approve up to 100,000 chips a year to the UAE, but that number jumped up to 500,000 a year until 2027, after talks. The current figure of exported chips under the new license has not been disclosed.

Content: China has quietly extended its rare-earth export controls into the heart of the semiconductor supply chain.

Based on a machine translation of a new notice published October 9, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said that exports of Chinese-origin rare earths or products made with them will now require government licenses if they’re linked to the development or manufacture of advanced chips — defined as logic at 14 nanometers or below, or memory with 256 layers or more.

The new measure builds on rules introduced in April, which imposed licensing requirements on seven rare-earth families, including samarium, terbium, dysprosium, and lutetium, as well as their magnet and sputtering-target forms. Those elements are central to chip fabrication and data storage, used in thin-film deposition, polishing compounds, and high-performance HDD motors, but the expansion goes further by introducing an end-use test tied directly to semiconductor thresholds and extending China’s jurisdiction beyond its borders.

Permits are available for purchase by active Griffith University Staff, Students and select contractors and tenants. The number of permits issued is restricted according to the type of permit and information obtained from regular parking and student attendance surveys. Despite this careful approach, there may be occasions at peak times when a person with a permit may not be able to find a parking space; in these instances, it may be necessary to wait a short time until a parking space becomes available.

Large datacentres need technology to keep growing, and America clearly wants to sit at the top of the AI pile. The United Arab Emirates may just sit on that pile alongside it, according to recent agreements.\nAs reported by Bloomberg, the US and the United Arab Emirates have reached an accord for the UAE to start taking in Nvidia processors for AI development. The Commerce Department Bureau of Industry and Security reportedly issued a license to Nvidia to export chips, but the specific number of processors has not yet been announced.\nThe US was previously in talks to approve up to 100,000 chips a year to the UAE, but that number jumped up to 500,000 a year until 2027, after talks. The current figure of exported chips under the new license has not been disclosed.\nThe original agreement earlier this year suggested that, of th...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 2:\nTitle: Campus-Based Permits\nURL: https://smartercity.com.au/campus-based-permits/\nContent: SMARTER PERMITS FOR UNIVERSITIES, HOSPITALS\n\nAND OTHER CAMPUS-BASED FACILITIES\n\nSeamlessly grant access and parking permits for your staff, employees, students, interns\n\nand visitors with our hands-free, hassle-free, and paper-free smarter permits.\n\nStudent\n\nPermits\n\nVisitor\n\nPermits\n\nStaff\n\nPermits\n\nVIP\n\nPermits\n\nDepartmental\n\nPermits\n\nOngoing\n\nPermits\n\nTime-limited\n\nPermits\n\nContactor\n\nPermits\n\n**VIRTUALISING PERMITS PROCESSING**\n\nvPermits seamlessly crosschecks eligibility requirements with your existing systems to instantly and\n\nautomatically process and grant (or deny) any type of permit:\n\nLODGED ONLINE\n\n**UNIQUE ID**\n\nLicense plate\n\nUniversity ID\n\nID\n\nOther\n\n**YOUR SYSTEMS**\n\nERP\n\nHR\n\nFinancials\n\nOther\n\nCROSS-REFERENCES THE DATA\n\nGRANTED OR DENIED\n\n**100% AUTOMATION = 0% PROCESSING**\n\n100%\n\nAutomated\n\n100%\n\nVirtual\n\n100%\n\nIntegrated\n\n100%\n\nCompliant\n\nSelf-\n\nServiced\n\nOptional\n\nSalary Sacrifice\n\nInstantly\n\nProcessed\n\nPaper\n\nFree\n\n**VIRTUALISE YOUR PERMITS TODAY! **\n\n## ALREADY TRUSTED BY\n\nSmarter City So...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 3:\nTitle: New Data Center Developments: October 2025\nURL: https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/data-center-construction/new-data-center-developments-october-2025\nContent: # New Data Center Developments: October 2025New Data Center Developments: October 2025\n\nWe look at some of the latest data center developments announced over the past month.Henry Chapman, Contributor\n\nOctober 9, 20258 Min Read\n\nThe demand for new data centers shows no signs of slowing.

Those elements are central to chip fabrication and data storage, used in thin-film deposition, polishing compounds, and high-performance HDD motors, but the expansion goes further by introducing an end-use test tied directly to semiconductor thresholds and extending China’s jurisdiction beyond its borders.\n\nUnder MOFCOM...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 5:\nTitle: Parking terms and conditions\nURL: https://www.griffith.edu.au/transport/parking/terms-and-conditions\nContent: The terms and conditions of parking at Griffith\n\nPermits are available for purchase by active Griffith University Staff, Students and select contractors and tenants.

Content: As data centers continue to expand, access to reliable and sufficient power has become one of the biggest constraints in site selection. Traditionally,

__energy developers__ and utilities have focused on generation interconnection queues, which track new power supply projects looking to connect to the grid. However, a shift is underway as load interconnection queues are gaining attention as a critical tool for understanding where large power consumers, like __data centers__, are planning to connect.

## What is a Load Interconnection Queue?

A load interconnection queue is a list maintained by an Independent System Operator (ISO) or utility that tracks major power consumers seeking to connect to the grid. These queues provide insights into where demand is growing and help utilities plan for infrastructure upgrades.

In contrast, a generation interconnection queue tracks new energy supply projects such as solar farms, wind projects, and traditional power plants that are requesting grid access. While generatio...

Transmission company Ausnet says it has received load enquiries for more than 8 GW of data centre capacity, some of them proposing loads bigger than the country’s aluminium smelters, the current largest energy users in Australia.

But the data centre companies don’t seem willing to site their projects in the middle of renewable energy zones, as some in the wind and solar industry hope.

Next DC’s head of energy Shayne Kumar says state and federal policy makers, and developers, are asking “almost on a weekly basis” whether the heavy electricity users can be homed in renewable energy zones (REZs).

<Limited-Disclosure> 
The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) conducted a survey of utilities across the world and found 
that almost half of the utilities have data center interconnection requests that exceed 50% of their present 
system peak demand. Nearly half of the utilities predict that over 10% of their peak demand in five years 
will come from data centers, and 26% of respondents believe data centers will constitute over 20% of their 
peak demand in five years [8].  
 
Furthermore, individual load interconnection request sizes have increased in recent years—predominantly 
driven by data centers and AI. Existing data center demand levels typically range from several up to 400 
MW. In the same EPRI survey, 60% of utilities have data center interconnection requests for 500 MW or

##### Australia’s data centre landscape

Australia’s data centres are smaller compared to giants in the US and China. Data centre capacity refers to the total amount of electrical power a data centre can draw on or use at any given time, measured in megawatts (MW), which is equivalent to 1 million watts. AirTrunk’s SYD1 data centre, with a capacity of more than 130 MW, is one of the largest in the region. However, in the US, mega-campuses are being developed with some already servicing 1000 MW – 1 gigawatt – of capacity.

Content: ### Hyperscalers will decide Australia’s data centre future, not the renewable energy sector

Much is being made of Australia’s potential as a home for data centres, but the industry may not be as much of a lock as people in the renewable and transmission businesses would like us to believe.

That decision rests in the hands of the AI hyperscalers Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple and Meta as to whether they buy the Australia-as-link-to-Asia opportunity, says Quinbrook managing director David Scaysbrook.

“[About] 40-50 per cent of the entire market, we’re talking about five hyperscalers, they’re the ones that are not only the biggest purchasers of renewable energy on the planet but they’re the ones driving this predominantly,” Scaysbrook said at the Australian Clean Energy summit (ACES) last week.

“So it’s the decisions they make about where they locate their [AI] training, where they decide to locate it.”

Content: ## Strategic location as a data centre hub

Australia is the ideal location to build green data centres to power Asia’s digital transformation. Australia has 17 subsea cables to Asia and the world. More are being built.

- Services to Asia: Australia can back up data storage and processing facilities for customers in Asia.

- Competitive power costs: Average industrial energy prices are low in Australia – compared to hubs in Asia, including Singapore.

- Incentives for green data centres: The Australian Government helps fund new green data centres.

Western Australia and the Northern Territory are likely to emerge as suppliers of data centre services to Asia. This is due to proximity, existing undersea cables and a shared time zone.

Content: Data centres are the engines of the internet. These large, high-security facilities host racks of servers that store and process our digital data, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

There are already more than 250 data centres across Australia. But there are set to be more, as the federal government’s plans for digital infrastructure expansion gains traction. We recently saw tech giant Amazon’s recent pledge to invest an additional A$20 billion in new data centres across Sydney and Melbourne, alongside the development of three solar farms in Victoria and Queensland to help power them.

The New South Wales government also recently launched a new authority to fast-track approvals for major infrastructure projects.

Content: NextDC plans to build a $2-billion next-generation digital campus at Fishermans Bend, solidifying Melbourne as a global key data centre growth zone, have moved ahead.

The M4 project had now won support from the Victorian Government to build on the 2.64ha site at 127 Todd Road, Port Melbourne.

Plans were filed in January, 15 months after NextDC completed its M3 facility at West Footscray, which followed on from the M1 at Port Melbourne and M2 at Tullamarine.

The M4 would replace the former Westgate Park Printing Complex, once home to one of the nation’s largest newspaper presses, operated by News Corp.

The M4 facility will include a so-called AI factory, mission critical operations centre and technology centre of excellence.

It will include up to 150mW of power across 50,000sq m of mission-critical facilities and liquid cooling facilities supporting rack densities exceeding 1000kW.

There will also be waste heat recovery for energy reuse, onsite solar and microgrids as well as recycled wastewater cooling....
