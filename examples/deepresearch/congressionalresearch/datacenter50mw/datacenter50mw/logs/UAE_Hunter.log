The "Stargate UAE" project is part of a deal brokered last week by U.S. President Donald Trump to build the world's largest set of AI data centers outside the United States, despite previous U.S. restrictions on sending advanced technology to the UAE because of its close ties to China.
The 10-square-mile (26-sq-km) site in Abu Dhabi will eventually host 5 gigawatts worth of data centers.
The first phase of that project will be the 1-gigawatt Stargate UAE project, built by state-backed UAE firm G42 in partnership with US firms OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia and Cisco Systems, as well as Japan's SoftBank Group. The companies on Thursday said that the Stargate UAE project will use Nvidia's Grace Blackwell GB300 systems, currently the most advanced AI server that Nvidia offers.

Content: ### OpenAI to build gigawatt Stargate data center in the UAE

OpenAI today announced plans to build a large artificial intelligence data center in the United Arab Emirates.

The facility is expected to consume 1 gigawatt of power at full capacity. One gigawatt corresponds to the electricity usage of about 700,000 homes. According to Reuters, it’s believed that the data center will house about 100,000 graphics processing units.

OpenAI is building the facility as part of a program called OpenAI for Countries that it debuted earlier this month. The initiative is modeled after Stargate, the ChatGPT’s developer push to establish a network of AI data centers in the U.S. at a cost of up to $500 billion. OpenAI will help countries that join the program build their own AI infrastructure.

The ChatGPT developer is partnering with Nvidia, Oracle Corp., Cisco Systems Inc., SoftBank Group Corp. and Emirati AI company G42 to build the upcoming UAE data center. The facility will be located on a 10-square-mile site in Abu D...

Data centres are the operational core of modern digital ecosystems. They enable cloud computing, financial systems, AI analytics, biometric databases, and secure communications. As demand for high-performance computing surges globally, hyperscale facilities capable of consuming tens of megawatts are becoming the norm. Hyperscale typically refers to facilities that house thousands of servers and span over 10,000 square meters (or about 100,000 square feet). A single hyperscale AI data centre can consume over 50 megawatts of power.

Control over these facilities offers geopolitical leverage, economic empowerment, and enhanced military capabilities. Economically, data centres are foundational for emerging sectors such as AI, smart cities, fintech, and digital media. From a security perspective, they serve as the central nervous system for command-and-control, intelligence analysis, and surveillance operations.

They enable cloud computing, financial systems, AI analytics, biometric databases, and secure communications. As demand for high-performance computing surges globally, hyperscale facilities capable of consuming tens of megawatts are becoming the norm. Hyperscale typically refers to facilities that house thousands of servers and span over 10,000 square meters (or about 100,000 square feet). A single hyperscale AI data centre can consume over 50 megawatts of power.\n\nControl over these facilities offers geopolitical leverage, economic empowerment, and enhanced military capabilities. Economically, data centres are foundational for emerging sectors such as AI, smart cities, fintech, and digital media. From a security perspective, they serve as the central nervous system for command-and-control, intelligence analysis, and surveillance operations.\n\nStrict data localisation laws have emerged acros...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 8:\nTitle: GCC\'s top five data centre projects - MEED\nURL: https://www.meed.com/gccs-top-five-data-centre-projects\nContent: # GCC’s top five data centre projects26 February 2025\n\n**By**Jennifer Aguinaldo\n\n**Register for MEED’s 14-day trial access **\n\nOver the past few weeks, tech companies and data centre operators have announced multibillion-dollars’ worth of planned investments in data centre projects and related digital infrastructure.\n\nCompanies such as Riyadh-based DataVolt, Ezditek and Al-Moammer Information Systems and Dubai-headquartered Gulf Data Hub have signed agreements to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled data centre facilities, primarily in Saudi Arabia.\n\nTelecom companies such as Qatar’s Ooredoo, Saudi Arabia’s STC and the UAE’s Du and E& are continuing the expansion of their data centre facilities, while firms such as the UAE’s Khazna Data Centres plan to expand their capacity at home and abroad.\n\nThe scale of data centre projects coming to the market over the next few years or months is unprecedented.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2024, the GCC states awarded an average of $1.2bn of data centre construction contrac...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'}
