Title: Equinix announces its highly sustainable SG6 data center
URL: https://w.media/equinix-announces-its-highly-sustainable-sg6-data-center/
Content: Equinix today announced its sixth data center in Singapore, which will be built with an initial investment of USD260 million. This new facility, set to open in Q1 2027, will offer 20MW of power upon completion. Equinix says SG6 will be covered by renewable energy and feature liquid cooling capabilities to support compute-intensive workloads, including AI.

Content: ## Description

The Singapore data centre landscape has changed significantly over the last several years. The build moratorium implemented in 2020 put a pause on data centre development activity. In early 2022, the moratorium was lifted, but only a relatively small chunk of capacity has been permitted for development and will be undertaken by a small group of providers. The end result of the Singaporean government’s evaluation of the data centre sector was a fundamental reshaping of the market. Going forward, the infrastructure built in Singapore will be more strategic, geared around connectivity, edge and AI workloads, while being aligned closely with sustainability considerations and benefits for the Singaporean economy.

With the new regulations in place, Singapore has essentially peaked as a data centre colocation market as infrastructure is starting to move into nearby overflow markets such as Johor Bahru in Malaysia and Batam in Indonesia. And this migration is starting to accelerate as emerging AI dem...

**Summary:** The Singapore government, through its Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) arm, unveiled plans to release at least another 300MW of additional data centre capacity through a new initiative called the ‘Green Data Centre Roadmap’.

**Details:** The stipulation surrounding this new data centre capacity allocation will be centred around what the government terms ‘green energy deployments’ which it hopes will lead to ‘innovative ways to accelerate energy efficiency, as well as seed hybrid ways to unlock further capacity through green energy’ across two main fronts:

- Accelerate the data centre’s energy efficiency at hardware and software levels, and allow industry and end users to put in place best-in-class technologies to maximise energy efficiency, capacity and economic potential.

** ResearchAndMarkets.com's** offering.

The Singapore Data Center Market was valued at USD 4.16 billion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 5.60 billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 5.08%.

This report analyses the Singapore data center market share. It elaborately analyses the existing and upcoming facilities and investments in IT, electrical, mechanical infrastructure, cooling systems, general construction, and tier standards.

Title: Singapore lays the groundwork for smart data center growth
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/singapore-lays-the-groundwork-for-smart-data-center-growth/
Content: In a move that stunned industry observers, Singapore announced on May 30 that it would release more data center capacity to the tune of 300MW, a substantial figure and a new policy direction for the nation-state.

Singapore had long held the position of a data center hub in Southeast Asia. However, climate concerns meant it had to dial back on its data center ambitions with a three-year moratorium a year before the pandemic hit. Since lifting the suspension, Singapore has allocated a mere 80MW for four new data centers under the Call for Application - Pilot Data Center (DC-CFA) scheme in 2023.

The commitment to provide 300MW “in the near term” is therefore a major development, but what prompted the shift? And what is Singapore’s strategy amid surging competition from its neighbors? Crucially, under what conditions can data center operators gain access to this newly released capacity?

Content: ## Description

The Singapore data centre landscape has changed significantly over the last several years. The build moratorium implemented in 2020 put a pause on data centre development activity. In early 2022, the moratorium was lifted, but only a relatively small chunk of capacity has been permitted for development and will be undertaken by a small group of providers. The end result of the Singaporean government’s evaluation of the data centre sector was a fundamental reshaping of the market. Going forward, the infrastructure built in Singapore will be more strategic, geared around connectivity, edge and AI workloads, while being aligned closely with sustainability considerations and benefits for the Singaporean economy.

With the new regulations in place, Singapore has essentially peaked as a data centre colocation market as infrastructure is starting to move into nearby overflow markets such as Johor Bahru in Malaysia and Batam in Indonesia. And this migration is starting to accelerate as emerging AI dem...

The Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) will award about 80 MW of new capacity to four data centre operators through the pilot Data Centre – Call for Application (DC-CFA) exercise. This is part of Singapore’s effort to enable the growth of DCs to support our digital economy in a sustainable manner consistent with our climate change commitments.

The build moratorium implemented in 2020 put a pause on data centre development activity. In early 2022, the moratorium was lifted, but only a relatively small chunk of capacity has been permitted for development and will be undertaken by a small group of providers. The end result of the Singaporean government’s evaluation of the data centre sector was a fundamental reshaping of the market. Going forward, the infrastructure built in Singapore will be more strategic, geared around connectivity, edge and AI workloads, while being aligned closely with sustainability considerations and benefits for the Singaporean economy.\n\nWith the new regulations in place, Singapore has essentially peaked as a data centre colocation market as infrastructure is starting to move into nearby overflow markets such as Johor Bahru in Malaysia and Batam in Indonesia.

The five story Digital Loyang II (SIN12) offers a total footprint of 34,000 sq m (370,000 sq ft), and is located down the road from Digital Loyang (SIN11) - which was redeveloped from an existing paper store in 2016. As we previously reported, the two data centers are just 350 meters apart, which made it trivial to link the two facilities with diverse high-count fiber.

Designed for highly energy-efficient operation with limited water usage and environmental impact, SIN12 has been awarded a Platinum certification under the BCA Green Mark building assessment system.
