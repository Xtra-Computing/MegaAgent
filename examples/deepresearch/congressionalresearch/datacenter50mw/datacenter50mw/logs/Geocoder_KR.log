Content: # LSグループと韓国電力が韓国のデータセンターに超電導送電網を構築... ### 2028年の完成を予定

LSグループは、韓国・京畿道加平（カピョン）にあるハイパースケールデータセンターに、世界初となる超電導送電網を構築するため、韓国電力公社（KEPCO）と提携しました。

LS Cable（LSケーブル）とLS Electric（LSエレクトリック）は、このプロジェクトに関する覚書（MoU）をKEPCOと締結しました。

この超電導送電網は、2028年までに完成予定の加平データセンターに導入される計画です。MoUの内容によると、KEPCOは技術検証と規制調整を担当し、LSケーブルは超電導ケーブルの設計と製造を、LSエレクトリックは超電導故障電流制限器やその他の電力機器の供給を担います。

LSエレクトリックの具滋均（ク・ジャギュン）会長は、「データセンター向けの世界初の超電導送電網において、電力業界を代表する3社が協力することは、非常に意義深いです」と述べました。... 超電導送電網は、AIデータセンターによって急増する電力需要に対応するための戦略的ソリューションとして注目されています。特定の温度で電気抵抗がゼロになる素材を使用することで、同じサイズの従来ケーブルよりもはるかに多くの電力を、ほとんど損失なく送電できます。

また、これらのシステムは省スペースかつコスト効率にも優れており、大型変電所を従来の約10分の1のサイズのコンパクトなユニットに置き換えることが可能です。さらに、超電導故障電流制限器は障害電流を瞬時に遮断できるため、機器の損傷やデータ損失を防ぎ、送電網全体の信頼性を高めます。

この技術の発展に向けて、3社は送電網技術の開発・実証における協力を拡大し、国際展開を視野に入れた取り組みも進めていく方針です。... LSグループは、電子、電力、素材、エネルギー分野で事業を展開する韓国の大手コングロマリットで、LS Cable & System、LS Electric、LS Nikko Copper、LS Mtronなどの企業で構成されています。

今月初めには、LSエレクトリックがNaver Cloudと提携し、AIを活用した電力システムおよびデータセンター運用の統合に取り組むことを発表しました。また昨年末には、韓国水力原子力公社と小型モジュール炉（SMR）技術を活用したAIデータセンターの開発...

The scale of the proposed data center is unprecedented, as data centers exceeding 1GW of power consumption are rare. The South Korean project will be nearly three times the size of the Stargate project—a Texas-based AI data center initiative led by OpenAI and SoftBank.

Stock Farm Road, an investment group spearheading the project, is co-founded by Brian Koo, grandson of the LG Group founder, and Amin Badr-El-Din, CEO of London- and Jordan-based BADR Investments. Koo, also known as Koo Bon-woong, is the son of the late Koo Ja-hong, the first chairman of LS Group, but has pursued venture investments independently of the conglomerate.

Content: # LSグループと韓国電力が韓国のデータセンターに超電導送電網を構築... ### 2028年の完成を予定

LSグループは、韓国・京畿道加平（カピョン）にあるハイパースケールデータセンターに、世界初となる超電導送電網を構築するため、韓国電力公社（KEPCO）と提携しました。

LS Cable（LSケーブル）とLS Electric（LSエレクトリック）は、このプロジェクトに関する覚書（MoU）をKEPCOと締結しました。

この超電導送電網は、2028年までに完成予定の加平データセンターに導入される計画です。MoUの内容によると、KEPCOは技術検証と規制調整を担当し、LSケーブルは超電導ケーブルの設計と製造を、LSエレクトリックは超電導故障電流制限器やその他の電力機器の供給を担います。

LSエレクトリックの具滋均（ク・ジャギュン）会長は、「データセンター向けの世界初の超電導送電網において、電力業界を代表する3社が協力することは、非常に意義深いです」と述べました。... 超電導送電網は、AIデータセンターによって急増する電力需要に対応するための戦略的ソリューションとして注目されています。特定の温度で電気抵抗がゼロになる素材を使用することで、同じサイズの従来ケーブルよりもはるかに多くの電力を、ほとんど損失なく送電できます。

また、これらのシステムは省スペースかつコスト効率にも優れており、大型変電所を従来の約10分の1のサイズのコンパクトなユニットに置き換えることが可能です。さらに、超電導故障電流制限器は障害電流を瞬時に遮断できるため、機器の損傷やデータ損失を防ぎ、送電網全体の信頼性を高めます。

この技術の発展に向けて、3社は送電網技術の開発・実証における協力を拡大し、国際展開を視野に入れた取り組みも進めていく方針です。... LSグループは、電子、電力、素材、エネルギー分野で事業を展開する韓国の大手コングロマリットで、LS Cable & System、LS Electric、LS Nikko Copper、LS Mtronなどの企業で構成されています。

今月初めには、LSエレクトリックがNaver Cloudと提携し、AIを活用した電力システムおよびデータセンター運用の統合に取り組むことを発表しました。また昨年末には、韓国水力原子力公社と小型モジュール炉（SMR）技術を活用したAIデータセンターの開発...

This airport opened for business on 29 March 2001, to replace the older Gimpo International Airport, which now serves mostly domestic destinations and shuttle flights to several East Asian metropolitan areas, including Beijing–Capital, Kaohsiung, Nagoya–Centrair, Osaka–Kansai, Shanghai–Hongqiao, Taipei–Songshan and Tokyo–Haneda.
