Content: ##### Jul 16, 2025 (0:24:25)
The latest episode of the Latin America podcast by datacenterHawk explores Mexico’s growing data center markets, focusing on Querétaro and Monterrey. Featuring insights from industry experts Steve Sasse, Regional Director of The Americas, and analysts Daniel Correira and Mafer Flores Segueda, the discussion highlights opportunities, challenges, and the future of these markets.

Querétaro – Mexico’s Data Center Hub

Querétaro is a key player in Mexico’s data center growth, with 250MW of commissioned capacity, 800MW in planning, and 30MW under construction. Its strong interconnectivity, with fiber routes through Monterrey and into the U.S., has attracted hyperscalers, making it one of the most interconnected regions in Mexico. However, growth has been slowed by energy grid limitations and bureaucratic hurdles. The panel stressed the need for private investments in power infrastructure to sustain future expansion.

Content: # Equinix completes US$57mn expansion of Mexican datacenter

Equinix has completed the third expansion phase of its MX2 datacenter in the metropolitan region of Mexico City.

Budgeted at US$57mn, the third phase added 1,200 cabinets of capacity to the site. This expansion is not expected to be the last.

This is because, even after this stage was completed, the facility still appears in Equinix's bookings as under “expansion” rather than “stabilized,” which is the status of a datacenter that has already been fully expanded.

The data were provided as part of the information supplied with Equinix's company's quarterly results.

Overall, the US giant delivered US$2.1bn in revenue in 1Q24, up 6% year-on-year.

The company currently has 50 major projects underway in 34 markets, across 21 countries.

This pipeline includes 14 hyperscale datacenters, representing more than 16,000 cabinets and over 50MW of capacity through the end of 2024, according to the company.

The latest episode of the Latin America podcast by datacenterHawk explores Mexico’s growing data center markets, focusing on Querétaro and Monterrey. Featuring insights from industry experts Steve Sasse, Regional Director of The Americas, and analysts Daniel Correira and Mafer Flores Segueda, the discussion highlights opportunities, challenges, and the future of these markets.

Querétaro – Mexico’s Data Center Hub

Querétaro is a key player in Mexico’s data center growth, with 250MW of commissioned capacity, 800MW in planning, and 30MW under construction. Its strong interconnectivity, with fiber routes through Monterrey and into the U.S., has attracted hyperscalers, making it one of the most interconnected regions in Mexico. However, growth has been slowed by energy grid limitations and bureaucratic hurdles. The panel stressed the need for private investments in power infrastructure to sustain future expansion.

Content: ##### Jul 16, 2025 (0:24:25)
The latest episode of the Latin America podcast by datacenterHawk explores Mexico’s growing data center markets, focusing on Querétaro and Monterrey. Featuring insights from industry experts Steve Sasse, Regional Director of The Americas, and analysts Daniel Correira and Mafer Flores Segueda, the discussion highlights opportunities, challenges, and the future of these markets.

Querétaro – Mexico’s Data Center Hub

Querétaro is a key player in Mexico’s data center growth, with 250MW of commissioned capacity, 800MW in planning, and 30MW under construction. Its strong interconnectivity, with fiber routes through Monterrey and into the U.S., has attracted hyperscalers, making it one of the most interconnected regions in Mexico. However, growth has been slowed by energy grid limitations and bureaucratic hurdles. The panel stressed the need for private investments in power infrastructure to sustain future expansion.
