Title: Microsoft gains construction permission for data center in Hollands Kroon
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/microsoft-gains-construction-permission-for-data-center-in-hollands-kroon/
Content: Microsoft has finally received construction permission for a new data center in the Hollands Kroon area in the north of the Netherlands, after a protracted permitting process.

This week the North Sea Canal Area Environment Agency (OD NZKG) granted the final environmental permit for the construction and operation of Microsoft’s AMS13/14 data center located at Cultuurweg 11 in Middenmeer (Het Venster).

The process for AMS13 and AMS14 has been a protracted one, and construction had already begun. The Hollands Kroon government previously granted Microsoft an environmental permit to begin construction work on a new data center in 2021, close to where the company already has an existing facility.

However, the province of Noord-Holland then ruled the municipality was not authorized to grant the permit and launched enforcement procedures against Microsoft for ‘operating without a permit.’

OD NZKG then issued a ‘tolerance decision’ allowing Microsoft to continue work ‘in anticipation of the final permit, but at th...

Content: Rapid Adoption of Liquid and Immersion Cooling to Maximise Rack Density

Dutch pioneers such as Asperitas have validated immersion cooling at commercial scale, enabling rack densities above 100 kW and reducing floor-space needs in real-estate-constrained Amsterdam. Switch Datacenters integrated dielectric-fluid tanks at its Amsterdam and newly acquired Woerden facilities, capturing waste heat for adjacent greenhouse operations and aligning with fiscal incentives tied to heat reuse. EU energy-efficiency directives require PUE disclosure, accelerating the shift toward direct-to-chip and immersion solutions that deliver sub-1.15 PUE scores. Liquid cooling adoption allows operators to defer brownfield expansions by extracting more compute from existing footprints, mitigating the impact of municipal moratoria on new hyperscale builds. As AI clusters proliferate, immersion systems become essential to maintaining GPU stability and fulfilling rack density requests from hyperscalers and research institutions.

Content: **From steam engines to AI clusters: a historical perspective**

Every technological revolution is supported by a specific infrastructure. Steam locomotives required extensive railway networks, electrification brought high-voltage grids, and the internet demanded fiber optic connections and data centers. Today, we are on the threshold of a new phase: large-scale artificial intelligence. AI is not a marginal technological innovation, but a fundamental productivity driver that is redefining industrial structures, value chains, and geopolitical power relations.

Historically, countries that invested early in the dominant infrastructure of their time achieved long-term economic and geopolitical advantages. In the 19th century, Great Britain built a railway network at record speed, the United States invested in a national highway system after World War II, and South Korea laid a digital backbone in the 1990s that now makes the country a world leader in semiconductors. Today, the focus is on large-scale, energy-int...

Title: Dutch grid crisis exposes Europe's AI energy infrastructure gap
URL: https://ppc.land/dutch-grid-crisis-exposes-europes-ai-energy-infrastructure-gap/
Content: Europe's digital ambitions collide with energy infrastructure limitations as the Netherlands experiences unprecedented grid congestion that serves as a harbinger for the continent's AI future. The crisis emerged prominently today, when the Financial Times published comprehensive reporting revealing that more than 11,900 businesses await electricity network connections across the Netherlands, forcing network operators to ration power supply.

The situation demonstrates Europe's unpreparedness for AI energy demands, with data centers requiring electricity consumption equivalent to 100,000 households each. According to the International Energy Agency, Europe accounts for approximately 15% of global data center electricity consumption at 70 TWh in 2024, yet this figure is projected to grow by more than 45 TWh by 2030 - a 70% increase that coincides with accelerated AI adoption across industries.

Title: Microsoft Netherlands Data Center Expands with 50 ...
URL: https://globalflowcontrol.com/newsroom/microsoft-netherlands-data-center-expansion/
Content: **Microsoft** has purchased 50 hectares of land in Middenmeer, the Netherlands, to expand its AMS13/14 **data center** campus.

Joris Schoonis, CEO of Microsoft Netherlands, explained that more than 300,000 customers want to store their data locally in a sovereign country, especially amid rising geopolitical tensions.

The land parcel is adjacent to Microsoft’s existing campus in Hollands Kroon, which received construction approval in 2023 after lengthy permitting and local opposition. Farmers in the region had voiced concerns about the project’s impact on water use.

Microsoft Netherlands’ director of data centers, Nick Hengelman, noted that the company plans to improve transparency and community relations. The expansion will include a public area designed to harvest rainwater for cooling.

To power the facility sustainably, Microsoft has an agreement with Vattenfall to source electricity from the nearby Wieringermeer wind farm.

The Middenmeer campus has been a focal point of public debate this year, reflec...

## Google breaks ground in Groningen

After quietly starting works last month, local press report that Google has officially begun work on a new data center in Winschoten, Groningen in the north of the country.

Marco Ynema, data center lead in the Netherlands at Google, told Dutch IT Channel: "People are increasingly using digital tools, and organizations and governments in the Netherlands are switching to the cloud. Google's commitment to the Netherlands is unprecedented and the start of construction of a new location in Winschoten today proves that. We are proud to have called the Netherlands our home for many years and look forward to many more years to come.”

The company will reportedly invest €600 million ($655.1m) into the new development, located at Hoogebrug 3.

Content: # Google purchases 20 hectares for new Netherlands data centre

The intention is for Google to expand its Netherlands presence, and build a new data centre on the plot.

## What will Google’s new Groningen data centre look like?

The plans for this data centre have been in the works for some time. According to Google, the site will only be a "small-scale satellite facility". Once complete, the data centre will have a 65 megawatt capacity.

The next steps are for the purchase agreement to be signed, after which Google can apply for an environmental permit. Then, if all goes as planned, the site can begin construction in Autumn 2023.

Google plans to build two of these smaller satellite data centres in this province, in order to support the operations of its larger Eemshaven data centre.

## The current status of the Netherlands data centre market

There’s a very good reason why Google has refrained from expanding this proposed site.

Title: Zeewolde approves Meta/Facebook to build Netherlands' largest data center
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/zeewolde-approves-metafacebook-to-build-netherlands-largest-data-center/
Content: The small town of Zeewolde has granted Meta a permit to build the largest data center in Netherlands, for its Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp applications.

The facility, which will potentially have five halls and use 200MW of electrical power, was approved on Thursday by a meeting of the council of the 22,000 population town, 50km East of Amsterdam in the province of Flevoland. The data center will be built on 166 hectares (410 acres) of farmland, currently known as Trekkersveld IV (Tractor field IV).

## Opposition

The role of data centers has been controversial in the Netherlands, with opponents claiming they soak up available renewable energy and land, and create very few jobs in return.

"Hyperscale data centers place an unreasonably large demand on the available renewable energy in relationship to their societal or economic value. We will be sharpening the national coordination and admissions criteria for licensing," said a statement from the coalition government published the day before Zeewolde appr...

Content: What was set to be the largest data center in the Netherlands will not come to be.

A huge planned data center in Zeewolde by Facebook owner Meta has officially been canceled, following the project being paused in March.

The facility was set to span five data halls and consume 200MW at full build, which would have made it the largest data center campus in the Netherlands. First revealed last year, the data center was proposed just before a ban on new data center constructions in its province of Flevoland, squeaking in before the moratorium was enacted. But that was about as far as the project ever got.

After initially being approved by the town of Zeewolde, the Dutch Senate late last year paused the sale of some of the land the facility was set to be built on, which is owned by the government.

In March, lawmakers in the Netherlands voted to stop any site preparation as they debated whether to sell the land. A month later, it said it did not plan to sell the land "at this time."

Content: # Meta permanently cancels plans to build Zeewolde data centre

__Meta__ has now - after a long back-and-forth period of delays and restarts - officially ended its plans to build the Zeewolde data centre.

## Why has Meta cancelled its Zeewolde data centre project?

Being one of the largest, most influential companies in the world, you’d think that there’d be very few things that could stand in the way of Meta’s plans.

Having first been revealed last year, the project would have become the largest data centre in the Netherlands, spanning five data halls and consuming 200MW when complete.

But, in the case of the Zeewolde data centre, there was simply too much pushback for the company to manage. Firstly, a ban on new data centre constructions in Flevoland was announced by the Netherlands government, just after Meta’s new data centre was proposed.

Then, even though it was initially approved by Zeewolde, in late 2021 the Dutch Senate decided to pause the sale of some of the land that Meta intended to build on....

Title: Meta Puts The Zeewolde Data Center Development on Hold Due To Political Opposition

Content: Meta has finally announced that it is pausing its plans for a mega data center in the Netherlands. The company said it would not be going forward with its plans for the facility in Zeewolde until further notice. Facebook gained approval for the facility from the Zeewolde council. However, it faced a lot of opposition from the country's politicians. A major bone of contention with Facebook was that part of the land it wanted to use to develop the data center belonged to the government.

If Facebook had succeeded in developing the facility, it would have been the largest in the country and one of the largest on the European continent. The company planned to develop a 200MW data center spanning five halls. A statement released by Meta said it believed in being amazing neighbors, which is why it had always maintained that a good relationship between the project and the community is important. Meta added that the current situation has made it impossible to continue with the project, so it is suspending it.

Title: Meta pauses Dutch data centre plans amid political pushback
URL: https://www.siliconrepublic.com/enterprise/meta-facebook-data-centres-netherlands-zeewolde
Content: Environmental campaigners and both local and national politicians have opposed the plans as the Netherlands seeks to rein in data centre development.

Meta has put its plans for a hyperscale data centre in the Dutch municipality of Zeewolde on hold in light of increasing political opposition.

The data centre, which was set to be the largest in The Netherlands, was planned for a 166-hectare site. It was expected to use 1.38 gigawatt hours of electricity generated from renewable sources and 400 permanent jobs were to be created alongside the investment.

The plans were approved by the local council in December. The majority of councillors voted to change Zeewolde’s zoning plan to facilitate the build. However, recent local elections have shifted power to those in opposition to Meta’s data centre plans.

Meta’s plans have also run aground at a national level. A week ago, the Dutch senate passed a motion asking the government to temporarily block construction on the site in Zeewolde until a government policy on ...

The data center will be built on 166 hectares (410 acres) of farmland, currently known as Trekkersveld IV (Tractor field IV).\n\n## Opposition\n\nThe role of data centers has been controversial in the Netherlands, with opponents claiming they soak up available renewable energy and land, and create very few jobs in return.\n\n"Hyperscale data centers place an unreasonably large demand on the available renewable energy in relationship to their societal or economic value.

First revealed last year, the data center was proposed just before a ban on new data center constructions in its province of Flevoland, squeaking in before the moratorium was enacted. But that was about as far as the project ever got.\n\nAfter initially being approved by the town of Zeewolde, the Dutch Senate late last year paused the sale of some of the land the facility was set to be built on, which is owned by the government.\n\nIn March, lawmakers in the Netherlands voted to stop any site preparation as they debated whether to sell the land.

Firstly, a ban on new data centre constructions in Flevoland was announced by the Netherlands government, just after Meta’s new data centre was proposed.\n\nThen, even though it was initially approved by Zeewolde, in late 2021 the Dutch Senate decided to pause the sale of some of the land that Meta intended to build on....\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 4:\nTitle: Meta Puts The Zeewolde Data Center Development on Hold Due To Political Opposition\nURL: https://baxtel.com/news/meta-puts-the-zeewolde-data-center-development-on-hold-due-to-political-opposition\nContent: Meta has finally announced that it is pausing its plans for a mega data center in the Netherlands. The company said it would not be going forward with its plans for the facility in Zeewolde until further notice. Facebook gained approval for the facility from the Zeewolde council. However, it faced a lot of opposition from the country\'s politicians. A major bone of contention with Facebook was that part of the land it wanted to use to develop the data center belonged to the government.\n\nIf Facebook had succeeded in developing the facility, it would have been the largest in the country and one of the largest on the European continent. The company planned to develop a 200MW data center spanning five halls. A statement released by Meta said it believed in being amazing neighbors, which is why it had always maintained that a good relationship between the project and the community is important.

Content: ## DNA of Switch Datacenters

Switch Datacenters was founded by a group of young entrepreneurs, including Gregor Snip, which were active in the hosting and internet infrastructure business in Amsterdam since 1998. Within a few years this start-up company had developed into a national leading web-provider and later hosting company in the Netherlands. The company had a a large installed base of hardware and software to be run efficiently at low opex. When co-locating their hosting equipment, they soon found out their colocation provider didn’t allow them the entrepreneurial freedom to grow. So they started their own datacenter directly across the road, called Switch Datacenters AMS1, in 2009.

Building and designing its own initial data halls over time and housing in fellow hosting companies caused a continuous need for optimization. This created a wealth of practical and theoretical datacenter construction- and planning knowledge. Switch rapidly turned into a professional datacenter operator and developer and ...

Title: Powering the AI century: Why utilities must lead | Guidehouse
URL: https://guidehouse.com/insights/communities-energy-infrastructure/2025/powering-the-ai-century
Content: ## The grid is no longer background

The U.S. power grid—and the utilities that operate it—are facing a paradigm shift unlike anything seen in the last century. The driver isn’t policy—it’s compute. AI is accelerating demand for large-load data centers at a pace that’s outstripping traditional utility planning cycles.

This isn’t a future problem. Burgeoning demand for AI data centers is already reshaping load profiles in Virginia, Texas, and other hot spots. Guidehouse Research predicts that Virginia’s data center load will approach half of the state’s overall power consumption by 2030—up from about a quarter today.

This shift is happening faster than most utilities are structurally prepared to handle. In Guidehouse’s tenth annual State and Future of the Power Industry pulse survey, more than 60% of utility leaders said they are ready for some load growth, but that system reliability needs are likely to temper upside.

Accelerated energy demand is coming, particularly over the next five years, but if utilit...

Content: Data center interconnection can strain the grid at multiple levels; the first step in designing the physical DERs-for-DCs solution is to identify the location of the bottleneck preventing interconnection. If the constraint is simply insufficient electricity generation capacity at the regional (i.e., balancing authority) level during hours of peak demand, DERs can supply capacity from anywhere in that region in the form of peak load shedding or shifting, or energy export from distributed batteries or generators (more on this below). Each can help balance supply and demand, acting in aggregate as a virtual power plant or a distributed power plant.

If the constraint is congestion at a specific node, for example an overloaded substation, the DERs must be behind that same node. The DER aggregation would be dispatched to avoid congestion, which may or may not coincide with the hours of regional system peak demand.

Our DATA+ expert, Elcke Vels, explores AI, cyber security, and Dutch innovation. Her "What if..." column imagines bold scenarios beyond the norm.

AI helps society move forward, but it has a downside: energy consumption is growing rapidly. So there is work to be done. The power grid, which is significantly overloaded, needs to be addressed, and data centers themselves need to become more sustainable.

[1]Baxtel Staff, “Top Data Center News From 15-20 July 2025,” Baxtel, baxtel.com Microsoft’s AMS14 site in Hollands Kroon exemplifies an outward shift from saturated Amsterdam toward municipalities offering power headroom and permitting support. These large-site strategies compress colocation vacancy, raise wholesale pricing, and propel demand for high-density electrical and cooling systems. Regulatory momentum around digital sovereignty further strengthens the position of hyperscalers able to document stringent compliance and audit frameworks.

Title: Dutch grid crisis exposes Europe's AI energy infrastructure gap

Content: Europe's digital ambitions collide with energy infrastructure limitations as the Netherlands experiences unprecedented grid congestion that serves as a harbinger for the continent's AI future. The crisis emerged prominently today, when the Financial Times published comprehensive reporting revealing that more than 11,900 businesses await electricity network connections across the Netherlands, forcing network operators to ration power supply.

The situation demonstrates Europe's unpreparedness for AI energy demands, with data centers requiring electricity consumption equivalent to 100,000 households each. According to the International Energy Agency, Europe accounts for approximately 15% of global data center electricity consumption at 70 TWh in 2024, yet this figure is projected to grow by more than 45 TWh by 2030 - a 70% increase that coincides with accelerated AI adoption across industries.

URL: https://www.dutchnews.nl/2022/02/dutch-call-a-halt-to-new-massive-data-centres-while-rules-are-worked-out/
Content: The Dutch government has imposed a nine-month moratorium on the building of new massive data centres for tech firms while new planning regulations are worked out.

In essence, the new rules will mean national government takes a central role in licencing new centres, which until now had been up to local authorities.

The decision does not impact on Facebook’s planned massive data centre, or hyperscale, in Zeewolde, which has caused major controversy because of its expected impact on electricity supplies.

Plans to build in two other locations – Eemshaven in Groningen (Google) and Middenmeer in Noord-Holland (Google and Microsoft) are also exempt from the moratorium because both areas are considered suitable locations.

Planning minister Hugo de Jonge is also looking into the option of confining new hyperscale centres to coastal areas, where they can be more easily connected to offshore wind farms – if there is enough scope for this.

Content: ### 4. What are the steps that need to be taken to secure data centre consent in your jurisdiction? How long does each steps in the process typically take?

- This strongly depends on whether the municipal zoning plan for the site envisaged for the data centre allows the construction and use of a data centre.

- If a data centre is allowed under the zoning plan, it is relatively easy to apply for a building permit. However, this does not mean a guarantee that the data centre can be realised, as environmental and nature protection laws also apply (see answers to questions 7 and 8).

- If a data centre is not allowed under the zoning plan, permission to deviate from the zoning plan is required. In that case, the municipality must make a consideration formfrom an urban planning point of view. Some local governments in areas that are attractive to data centre developers have developed policies, stating in which areas and under what conditions data centres are still allowed.

Content: The new council in the Noord-Holland municipality of Hollands Kroon wants to prevent more data centers from being developed in the area, despite it being one of only two regions in the Netherlands exempt from a government ban on hyperscale data centers.

“In recent years, many large-scale developments have taken place in the Wieringermeer in a short period of time, leaving insufficient space for participation and social debate about the effects on the living and living environment. That is why we are first taking a step back with large-scale developments such as new data centers and greenhouses,” the new coalition of Independent Hollands Kroon, Senioren Hollands Kroon, GL, PvdA and D66 said this week.

The council is due to discuss the proposal – which would also limit the number of industrial-scale greenhouses being built – this week.

Her "What if..." column imagines bold scenarios beyond the norm.\n\nAI helps society move forward, but it has a downside: energy consumption is growing rapidly. So there is work to be done. The power grid, which is significantly overloaded, needs to be addressed, and data centers themselves need to become more sustainable.

The crisis emerged prominently today, when the Financial Times published comprehensive reporting revealing that more than 11,900 businesses await electricity network connections across the Netherlands, forcing network operators to ration power supply.\n\nThe situation demonstrates Europe\'s unpreparedness for AI energy demands, with data centers requiring electricity consumption equivalent to 100,000 households each. According to the International Energy Agency, Europe accounts for approximately 15% of global data center electricity consumption at 70 TWh in 2024, yet this figure is projected to grow by more than 45 TWh by 2030 - a 70% increase that coincides with accelerated AI adoption across industries.\n\n** ✉️ for similar stories like this one.

Content: Microsoft has finally received construction permission for a new data center in the Hollands Kroon area in the north of the Netherlands, after a protracted permitting process.

This week the North Sea Canal Area Environment Agency (OD NZKG) granted the final environmental permit for the construction and operation of Microsoft’s AMS13/14 data center located at Cultuurweg 11 in Middenmeer (Het Venster).

The process for AMS13 and AMS14 has been a protracted one, and construction had already begun. The Hollands Kroon government previously granted Microsoft an environmental permit to begin construction work on a new data center in 2021, close to where the company already has an existing facility.

However, the province of Noord-Holland then ruled the municipality was not authorized to grant the permit and launched enforcement procedures against Microsoft for ‘operating without a permit.’

OD NZKG then issued a ‘tolerance decision’ allowing Microsoft to continue work ‘in anticipation of the final permit, but at th...

Content: The Dutch government has imposed a nine-month moratorium on the building of new massive data centres for tech firms while new planning regulations are worked out.

In essence, the new rules will mean national government takes a central role in licencing new centres, which until now had been up to local authorities.

The decision does not impact on Facebook’s planned massive data centre, or hyperscale, in Zeewolde, which has caused major controversy because of its expected impact on electricity supplies.

Plans to build in two other locations – Eemshaven in Groningen (Google) and Middenmeer in Noord-Holland (Google and Microsoft) are also exempt from the moratorium because both areas are considered suitable locations.

Planning minister Hugo de Jonge is also looking into the option of confining new hyperscale centres to coastal areas, where they can be more easily connected to offshore wind farms – if there is enough scope for this.

Due to its strategic geographical position, its advanced digital infrastructure and its strong commitment to sustainability, the Dutch data center market, particularly in Amsterdam, is significant on the global stage.

Notwithstanding its growth, the Dutch data center market faces various challenges, such as high energy costs, competition for skilled personnel, limited land availability for expansion, power grid congestion and regulatory constraints related to environmental impact. Given rising global demand for data centers, these challenges strain the country’s ability to meet growth expectations essential to keeping the Netherlands competitive in the sector.

Content: The Dutch government has announced it will impose stricter rules for hyperscale data centers - and has banned new projects for nine months, while the new rules are worked out.

The ban will not affect Facebook's effort to build in Zeewolde, though this currently faces difficulties due to a government land sale. Other previously approved plans will go ahead, and projects such as Google's Groningen project, and others in Middenmeer will be allowed to go ahead because these areas are exempt from the ban.

"Our space is limited, so we have to make the right choices," said housing and planning minister Hugo De Jonge in a letter to the House of Representatives, according to a report on the Netherlands government website. "Hyperscale data centers take up a lot of space and consume a disproportionate amount of available renewable energy. That is why the cabinet wants to prevent hyperscale data centers being built throughout the Netherlands."

**National Strategy on Planning (NOVI)**

This NOVI is broadly based on the Spatial Strategy Data Centers 2030 (

*Ruimtelijke Strategie Data centers*). 1 The policy decision aims to ensure that, for the digitalization of the economy, in cooperation with other governments, network operators and the business community, the national government will focus on the rollout of new networks and selective growth of data centers. On this basis, data centers may be located where (cumulatively):

- the energy demand can be met sustainably via current or future energy networks;

- the supply of residual heat to the district heating; and

- they meet the market requirements for digital connectivity.

The government's commitment is to facilitate co-location in the Amsterdam metropolitan area

Title: Navigating Dutch data centre challenges and opportunities
URL: https://www.haskoning.com/en/newsroom/blogs/2023/navigating-dutch-data-centre-challenges-and-opportunities
Content: Over the years, data centres have experienced significant growth. What was once considered a massive 2 MW IT load twenty years ago is now overshadowed by campuses capable of handling over 60 MW to 100 MW at a single site. This expansion poses several challenges for the existing data centre sites, with adaptability being the primary concern for both the building and its infrastructure.

Over time, many data centre sites were developed to accommodate IT loads prevalent during construction. However, as IT infrastructure advanced, the space required to handle the same IT load decreased. The question thus arises: are existing brownfield sites facing obsoletion challenges and how to ensure the sites remain prepared for future demands and advancements?

It all starts with capacity, density and logistics assessment. Assessing the current and future IT load requirements forms the foundation of your decision-making process. Understanding the necessary flexibility for your facility is crucial to adapt your building. The...

Content: Following publication of Haarlemmermeer’s current local policy, the city only allows for moderate growth and concentration of data centers until 2030 with 550 megavolt amperes (in addition to some data centers for which environmental permit applications have already been submitted).5 No additional space for data centers is available in Haarlemmermeer after 2030 (except for some specific locations).These conditions relate to the spatial quality and landscape integration, energy use and sustainability of the data centers.

The policy has been implemented in two steps. The first step is the umbrella zoning plan6 in which a number of aspects of the data center policy are regulated (

*paraplubestemmingsplan*). This sets out the first group of important spatial elements for new data centers or the expansion of existing data centers. Under these conditions, it will still be possible to build a new data center in the coming years if the spatial plan already allows and additional landscaping and sustainability criter...

Content: With great pleasure, we present the 10th edition of our ‘State of the Dutch Data Centers’ report. This milestone edition, themed ‘Powering Progress’ reflects our continuous efforts to strengthen the data center industry in the Netherlands.

The annual DDA market report State of the Dutch Data Centers assesses the Dutch data center market by conducting a survey among DDA member data centers. The study presents, among other things, the expected growth of the sector (regional, national, and international) and looks ahead to sustainability initiatives the sector is pursuing.

**Powering Progress **

In this report, we highlight the critical developments that are shaping our industry. From the increasing demand for data processing power to steps taken in green energy solutions. The report identifies two significant threats: the shortage of skilled employees and the uncertainties surrounding our power grid. These challenges must be addressed to ensure a strong digital infrastructure.

Content: **From steam engines to AI clusters: a historical perspective**

Every technological revolution is supported by a specific infrastructure. Steam locomotives required extensive railway networks, electrification brought high-voltage grids, and the internet demanded fiber optic connections and data centers. Today, we are on the threshold of a new phase: large-scale artificial intelligence. AI is not a marginal technological innovation, but a fundamental productivity driver that is redefining industrial structures, value chains, and geopolitical power relations.

Historically, countries that invested early in the dominant infrastructure of their time achieved long-term economic and geopolitical advantages. In the 19th century, Great Britain built a railway network at record speed, the United States invested in a national highway system after World War II, and South Korea laid a digital backbone in the 1990s that now makes the country a world leader in semiconductors. Today, the focus is on large-scale, energy-int...

Title: Dutch government halts hyperscale data centers, pending new rules
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/dutch-government-halts-hyperscale-data-centers-pending-new-rules/
Content: The Dutch government has announced it will impose stricter rules for hyperscale data centers - and has banned new projects for nine months, while the new rules are worked out.

The ban will not affect Facebook's effort to build in Zeewolde, though this currently faces difficulties due to a government land sale. Other previously approved plans will go ahead, and projects such as Google's Groningen project, and others in Middenmeer will be allowed to go ahead because these areas are exempt from the ban.

"Our space is limited, so we have to make the right choices," said housing and planning minister Hugo De Jonge in a letter to the House of Representatives, according to a report on the Netherlands government website. "Hyperscale data centers take up a lot of space and consume a disproportionate amount of available renewable energy. That is why the cabinet wants to prevent hyperscale data centers being built throughout the Netherlands."

Title: Navigating Dutch data centre challenges and opportunities
URL: https://www.haskoning.com/en/newsroom/blogs/2023/navigating-dutch-data-centre-challenges-and-opportunities
Content: Over the years, data centres have experienced significant growth. What was once considered a massive 2 MW IT load twenty years ago is now overshadowed by campuses capable of handling over 60 MW to 100 MW at a single site. This expansion poses several challenges for the existing data centre sites, with adaptability being the primary concern for both the building and its infrastructure.

Over time, many data centre sites were developed to accommodate IT loads prevalent during construction. However, as IT infrastructure advanced, the space required to handle the same IT load decreased. The question thus arises: are existing brownfield sites facing obsoletion challenges and how to ensure the sites remain prepared for future demands and advancements?

It all starts with capacity, density and logistics assessment. Assessing the current and future IT load requirements forms the foundation of your decision-making process. Understanding the necessary flexibility for your facility is crucial to adapt your building. The...

**1. Given the arguments for the realization of data centers, there is good reason to believe that the placement of electrolysers for hydrogen production - which can also have a major impact on the landscape and on the connection to the electricity grid - should not be left to the market and decentralized authorities alone.

Title: Challenges in the Dutch Data Center Market | Insights

Content: The Netherlands, widely acclaimed for its tulips, windmills, and cheese, is also an important player in a different realm: the data center market. Due to its strategic geographical position, its advanced digital infrastructure and its strong commitment to sustainability, the Dutch data center market, particularly in Amsterdam, is significant on the global stage.

Notwithstanding its growth, the Dutch data center market faces various challenges, such as high energy costs, competition for skilled personnel, limited land availability for expansion, power grid congestion and regulatory constraints related to environmental impact. Given rising global demand for data centers, these challenges strain the country’s ability to meet growth expectations essential to keeping the Netherlands competitive in the sector.

One of the current impediments to industry growth is the scarcity of suitable locations in the Netherlands, especially because the Dutch government has imposed new rules for hyperscale data centers, and the...

Content: ## Segment Analysis

By Data Center Size: Hyperscale Scaling Outpaces Legacy Footprints

Large facilities retained 41.88% Netherlands data center market share in 2024, reflecting entrenched enterprise and multi-tenant demand clustered around Amsterdam’s carrier hotels. However, mega campuses are projected to post a 6.70% CAGR to 2030 as hyperscalers condense compute into fewer, energy-efficient locations. The Netherlands data center market size for mega facilities is set to exceed 800 MW by 2030, driven by Oracle’s USD 1 billion AI deployment and Google’s phased Westpoort build. Mega sites justify capital-intensive liquid cooling and onsite substation investments that smaller footprints cannot amortize. At the other end, small and micro data centers address edge latency targets but face cost headwinds tied to staffing and remote management.

Enterprises in regulated industries adopt a phased migration path, using medium facilities as interim hybrid-cloud staging grounds before contracting dedicated hyperscale...

Title: The Netherlands' Hollands Kroon wants to pause hyperscale data center developments
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/the-netherlands-hollands-kroon-wants-to-pause-hyperscale-developments/
Content: The new council in the Noord-Holland municipality of Hollands Kroon wants to prevent more data centers from being developed in the area, despite it being one of only two regions in the Netherlands exempt from a government ban on hyperscale data centers.

“In recent years, many large-scale developments have taken place in the Wieringermeer in a short period of time, leaving insufficient space for participation and social debate about the effects on the living and living environment. That is why we are first taking a step back with large-scale developments such as new data centers and greenhouses,” the new coalition of Independent Hollands Kroon, Senioren Hollands Kroon, GL, PvdA and D66 said this week.

The council is due to discuss the proposal – which would also limit the number of industrial-scale greenhouses being built – this week.

This milestone edition, themed ‘Powering Progress’ reflects our continuous efforts to strengthen the data center industry in the Netherlands.\n\nThe annual DDA market report State of the Dutch Data Centers assesses the Dutch data center market by conducting a survey among DDA member data centers. The study presents, among other things, the expected growth of the sector (regional, national, and international) and looks ahead to sustainability initiatives the sector is pursuing.\n\n**Powering Progress **\n\nIn this report, we highlight the critical developments that are shaping our industry. From the increasing demand for data processing power to steps taken in green energy solutions. The report identifies two significant threats: the shortage of skilled employees and the uncertainties surrounding our power grid. These challenges must be addressed to ensure a strong digital infrastructure.\n\nThe theme ‘Powering Progress’ ...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 3:\nTitle: AI-ready Netherlands: how we are preparing our ...\nURL: https://www.dutchdatacenters.nl/en/nieuws/ai-ready-netherlands-how-we-are-preparing-our-infrastructure-for-artificial-intelligence/\nContent: **From steam engines to AI clusters: a historical perspective**\n\nEvery technological revolution is supported by a specific infrastructure. Steam locomotives required extensive railway networks, electrification brought high-voltage grids, and the internet demanded fiber optic connections and data centers. Today, we are on the threshold of a new phase: large-scale artificial intelligence. AI is not a marginal technological innovation, but a fundamental productivity driver that is redefining industrial structures, value chains, and geopolitical power relations.\n\nHistorically, countries that invested early in the dominant infrastructure of their time achieved long-term economic and geopolitical advantages. In the 19th century, Great Britain built a railway network at record speed, the United States invested in a national highway system after World War II, and South Korea laid a digital backbone in the 1990s that now makes the country a world leader in semiconductors. Today, the focus is on large-scale, energy-int...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 4:\nTitle: Dutch government halts hyperscale data centers, pending new rules\nURL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/dutch-government-halts-hyperscale-data-centers-pending-new-rules/\nContent: The Dutch government has announced it will impose stricter rules for hyperscale data centers - and has banned new projects for nine months, while the new rules are worked out.\n\nThe ban will not affect Facebook\'s effort to build in Zeewolde, though this currently faces difficulties due to a government land sale. Other previously approved plans will go ahead, and projects such as Google\'s Groningen project, and others in Middenmeer will be allowed to go ahead because these areas are exempt from the ban.\n\n"Our space is limited, so we have to make the right choices," said housing and planning minister Hugo De Jonge in a letter to the House of Representatives, according to a report on the Netherlands government website. "Hyperscale data centers take up a lot of space and consume a disproportionate amount of available renewable energy. That is why the cabinet wants to prevent hyperscale data centers being built throughout the Netherlands."\n\nThe letter goes on to promise that there will be tighter national control w...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 5:\nTitle: Navigating Dutch data centre challenges and opportunities\nURL: https://www.haskoning.com/en/newsroom/blogs/2023/navigating-dutch-data-centre-challenges-and-opportunities\nContent: Over the years, data centres have experienced significant growth. What was once considered a massive 2 MW IT load twenty years ago is now overshadowed by campuses capable of handling over 60 MW to 100 MW at a single site. This expansion poses several challenges for the existing data centre sites, with adaptability being the primary concern for both the building and its infrastructure.\n\nOver time, many data centre sites were developed to accommodate IT loads prevalent during construction. However, as IT infrastructure advanced, the space required to handle the same IT load decreased. The question thus arises: are existing brownfield sites facing obsoletion challenges and how to ensure the sites remain prepared for future demands and advancements?\n\nIt all starts with capacity, density and logistics assessment. Assessing the current and future IT load requirements forms the foundation of your decision-making process. Understanding the necessary flexibility for your facility is crucial to adapt your building.

The questions were raised by the Senate fractions of GL and PvdD.\n\nDate Sept. 26, 2022\n\nSubject Questions on hyperscale data centers\n\nI hereby offer you the answers to the written questions submitted by members of the Green Left and Party for the Animals (PvdD) groups. These questions were submitted on July 12, with reference 171510.02U\n\nMinister of Housing and Urban Development,\n\nHugo de Jonge\n\n**Questions and comments from members of the Green Left Group **\n\n**1. Given the arguments for the realization of data centers, there is good reason to believe that the placement of electrolysers for hydrogen production - which can also have a major impact on the landscape and on the connection to the electricity grid - should not be left to the market and decentralized authorities alone.

Due to its strategic geographical position, its advanced digital infrastructure and its strong commitment to sustainability, the Dutch data center market, particularly in Amsterdam, is significant on the global stage.\n\nNotwithstanding its growth, the Dutch data center market faces various challenges, such as high energy costs, competition for skilled personnel, limited land availability for expansion, power grid congestion and regulatory constraints related to environmental impact. Given rising global demand for data centers, these challenges strain the country’s ability to meet growth expectations essential to keeping the Netherlands competitive in the sector.\n\nOne of the current impediments to industry growth is the scarcity of suitable locations in the Netherlands, especially because the Dutch government has imposed new rules for hyperscale data centers, and the...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 8:\nTitle: Netherlands Data Center Market Size & Share Analysis\nURL: https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/netherlands-data-center-market\nContent: ## Segment Analysis\n\nBy Data Center Size: Hyperscale Scaling Outpaces Legacy Footprints\n\nLarge facilities retained 41.88% Netherlands data center market share in 2024, reflecting entrenched enterprise and multi-tenant demand clustered around Amsterdam’s carrier hotels. However, mega campuses are projected to post a 6.70% CAGR to 2030 as hyperscalers condense compute into fewer, energy-efficient locations. The Netherlands data center market size for mega facilities is set to exceed 800 MW by 2030, driven by Oracle’s USD 1 billion AI deployment and Google’s phased Westpoort build. Mega sites justify capital-intensive liquid cooling and onsite substation investments that smaller footprints cannot amortize. At the other end, small and micro data centers address edge latency targets but face cost headwinds tied to staffing and remote management.\n\nEnterprises in regulated industries adopt a phased migration path, using medium facilities as interim hybrid-cloud staging grounds before contracting dedicated hyperscale...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 9:\nTitle: The Netherlands\' Hollands Kroon wants to pause hyperscale data center developments\nURL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/the-netherlands-hollands-kroon-wants-to-pause-hyperscale-developments/\nContent: The new council in the Noord-Holland municipality of Hollands Kroon wants to prevent more data centers from being developed in the area, despite it being one of only two regions in the Netherlands exempt from a government ban on hyperscale data centers.\n\n“In recent years, many large-scale developments have taken place in the Wieringermeer in a short period of time, leaving insufficient space for participation and social debate about the effects on the living and living environment. That is why we are first taking a step back with large-scale developments such as new data centers and greenhouses,” the new coalition of Independent Hollands Kroon, Senioren Hollands Kroon, GL, PvdA and D66 said this week.\n\nThe council is due to discuss the proposal – which would also limit the number of industrial-scale greenhouses being built – this week.\n\nDespite being one of the major data center markets in Europe – the A in the so-called FLAP-D markets of Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Dublin – the Netherlands has h...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 10:\nTitle: Netherlands Hyperscale Data Center Market Size and Share\nURL: https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/netherlands-hyperscale-data-center-market\nContent: ## Netherlands Hyperscale Data Center Market Trends and Insights\n\nDrivers Impact Analysis\n\n|Driver|(~) % Impact on CAGR Forecast|Geographic Relevance|Impact Timeline|\n|--|--|--|--|\n|GPU-centric AI/ML demand for >50 kW racks|+8.50%|Amsterdam and Flevoland|Medium term (2-4 years)|\n|Surging cloud-migration of Dutch enterprises|+6.20%|Nationwide (North and South Holland early gains)|Short term (≤ 2 years)|\n|Amsterdam’s dense IX/peering ecosystem|+4.80%|Amsterdam metro, adjacent provinces|Long term (≥ 4 years)|\n|EU-GDPR and digital-sovereignty compliance|+3.70%|EU-wide; NL as gateway hub|Medium term (2-4 years)|\n|SMR-powered campus pilots in Eemshaven|+2.10%|Northern Netherlands|Long term (≥ 4 years)|\n|District heat-reuse subsidies in North Holland|+1.90%|North Holland, expanding|Medium term (2-4 years)|\n|Source: Mordor Intelligence|\nGPU-centric AI/ML demand for greater than 50 kW racks...
