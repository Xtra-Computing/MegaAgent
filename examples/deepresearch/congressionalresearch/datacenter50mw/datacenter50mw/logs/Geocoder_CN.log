Shanghai Supercomputer Center (SSC) is a high-performance computing facility located in the Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park in Pudong, Shanghai, China. Established in December 2000, it was the country's first public high-performance computing service platform open for general use. Funded by the Shanghai Municipal Government, the SSC provides advanced supercomputing resources for scientific research and industrial applications.

#### History and establishment

The Shanghai Supercomputer Center was officially founded on December 28, 2000, as an initiative to bolster China's scientific computing capabilities. From the outset, its mission was to offer high-performance computing services to a broad community of users, helping to bridge a crucial gap in the country's research infrastructure. Located in Shanghai's Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park, the center was established with funding from the Shanghai Municipal Government. Upon opening, SSC deployed its first supercomputer, the Shenwei-I, a massively parallel system...

**Zhangjiang High Technology Park** (simplified Chinese: 张江高科; traditional Chinese: 張江高科; pinyin: *Zhāngjiāng Gāokē*) is a station on Line 2 of the Shanghai Metro. This station had been the line's eastern terminus from 27 December 2000, after an eastward extension from Longyang Road to Zhangjiang High Technology Park opened, until 24 February 2010, when the line was extended further eastward to Guanglan Road. From 14 to 23 February 2010, this station was shut down, and Line 2 service terminated at Longyang Road, to allow for reconstruction work; the new underground Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park station was built on the northeast side of the old, elevated station. This conversion allowed for greater compatibility with the 24 February 2010 opening of Jinke Road and Guanglan Road stations, which are both underground.

**Zhongguancun** (Chinese: 中关村) is a major technology hub in the Haidian District, Beijing, China.

Zhongguancun occupies a band between the northwestern Third Ring Road and the northwestern Fourth Ring Road in the northwestern part of Beijing. Zhongguancun is sometimes known as China's Silicon Valley. The place is also the center of the Beijing-Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Hi-Tech Industrial Belt.

## History

Chen Chunxian envisioned Zhongguancun, which then became a well-known technology hub 30 years later. Chunxian, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), conceived of a Silicon Valley in China following a government-sponsored trip to Boston and Silicon Valley, United States.

Zhongguancun became known as "Electronics Avenue" (simplified Chinese: 电子一条街; traditional Chinese: 電子一條街; pinyin: *Diànzǐ Yītiáojiē*) in the early 1980s, due to its information technology markets along a central, crowded street.
