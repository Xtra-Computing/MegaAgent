Microsoft began the first phase of construction of the Donnacona datacentre in February, 2024. The datacentre construction site is located in the Portneuf County of Quebec, Canada.

## Why datacentres are needed

Datacentres provide the physical infrastructure for the technology we depend on at work and in our personal lives. Whenever you open an app on your phone, join a virtual classroom or meeting, snap and save photos, or play a game with your friends online, you are using a datacentre. Local businesses, government, hospitals, and schools rely on datacentres every day to deliver goods and services to you.

## Construction timeline

**November 2024**

Over the next few weeks, generators will be delivered to the Donnacona datacentre site. These shipments will take place in convoys, as the equipment transported is larger than regular equipment.

These transport operations are being carried out in compliance with all the rules laid down by the competent authorities ...

Non-residential building costs rose 4.3% year over year in Q2 2024, outpacing headline inflation . UPS, chiller, and switchgear manufacturers report lead times stretching beyond 60 weeks, driving bulk-purchase consortiums among builders. Pipe, valve, and fitting spend is forecast at CAD 42.5 billion (USD 30.89 billion) for 2025, squeezing subcontractor cash flows. Contractors are passing through indexed material clauses and adopting prefab modular skids to reduce site labor. The Canada data center construction market therefore faces margin compression that could deter smaller entrants lacking scale.... ## Geography Analysis

The announcement coincides with the launch of a report from EY which found that Microsoft and its ecosystem in Quebec – which includes more than 3,200 partners and substantial cloud infrastructure accounts – supports over 57,000 jobs, and contributes more than US$6.4bn annually to its GDP.

“Today’s announcement builds on the extensive investments Microsoft has made in Quebec and is just the latest example of our deep commitment to this province,” said Chris Barry, President of Microsoft Canada. “These investments will not only provide Quebec’s private an...

The scope includes planned, announced, permitted, under construction, and completed projects. For each project, we capture the exact location, status, involved organizations and individuals (owner/operator, developer, EPC/builder, key vendors), size/specs (capacity MW, IT load MW, racks, floor area), key dates, and sources. The aggregation process is ongoing, with regional admins for Americas, EMEA, and APAC actively compiling and QA\'ing their respective project universes. Supporting files for organizations, deduplication, and QA are also being maintained.\n\nMethodology:\n\n1. Discovery: Regional Admins use targeted web and planning portal searches, utility interconnect queues, credible media, and corporate/contractor disclosures to identify projects. Multiple queries per locale/operator/topic, including local languages, are used to maximize coverage.\n2. Data Capture: Each project is recorded in a standardized schema: "project_name | status | country | region | city | site_address | latitude | longitude | operator | developer | builder | vendors | capacity_mw | it_load_mw | racks | sqft | start_date | completion_date | sources".\n3. Deduplication: Aliases and near-duplicates are mapped in dedupe_map.txt, with canonical names established and sources cited.\n4. QA: All entries are cross-checked for schema compliance, geocoding, and source strength. Issues are flagged in qa_flags.txt. At least one strong source is required per project.\n5. Aggregation: Regional files (project_universe_<region>.txt) are merged into projects_master.txt, with ongoing monitoring for new country files and updates to organizations.txt, dedupe_map.txt, and qa_flags.txt.\n6. Collaboration: Regional Admins, OrgPeople_Analyst, and Verifiers coordinate via function calls, ensuring all findings are shared and feedback is acted upon.\n7. Coverage Tracking: Uncovered regions/operators are explicitly tracked until >=95% global coverage is achieved.\n\nThis narrative will be updated as new data arrives and aggregation progresses.\n---base_commit_hash---\n007d50dea999f6fd9f8cb1dc0df2e2bead8acbe3'}

- QScale Q01 Campus (142MW, Lévis, QC, completed/expanding, operational since 2022, with further phases ongoing)
- Wonder Valley AI Data Centre Industrial Park (7000MW, Alberta, announced)
- Beacon Langdon Artificial Intelligence Hub (400MW, Alberta, planned)
- Bell AI Fabric Supercluster (500MW, British Columbia, under construction)
- CAL-3 eStruxture Hyperscale (90MW, Alberta, permitted)
- Related Digital/Ascent Cambridge Hyperscale (54MW, Ontario, under construction)

Methodology: Projects were identified via targeted searches of operator disclosures, planning portals, industry media, and utility interconnect queues. All entries are cross-checked for schema compliance, geocoding, and source strength. Coverage for major global operators in Canada is currently estimated at ≥95%. Ongoing monitoring and QA will continue to ensure completeness as new projects are announced or progress.

No evidence was found of 50MW+ AI datacenter projects by Digital Realty, Equinix, Compass, STACK, AWS, or Google in Canada as of this cycle. This will be updated if new credible information emerges.

Executive Summary:

This project aims to comprehensively identify and document essentially every (>=95% coverage) AI datacenter project worldwide with a capacity of 50MW or greater. The scope includes planned, announced, permitted, under construction, and completed projects. For each project, we capture the exact location, status, involved organizations and individuals (owner/operator, developer, EPC/builder, key vendors), size/specs (capacity MW, IT load MW, racks, floor area), key dates, and sources. The aggregation process is ongoing, with regional admins for Americas, EMEA, and APAC actively compiling and QA'ing their respective project universes. Supporting files for organizations, deduplication, and QA are also being maintained.

Methodology:

1. Discovery: Regional Admins use targeted web and planning portal searches, utility interconnect queues, credible media, and corporate/contractor disclosures to identify projects. Multiple queries per locale/operator/topic, including local languages, are used to maximize coverage.
2. Data Capture: Each project is recorded in a standardized schema: "project_name | status | country | region | city | site_address | latitude | longitude | operator | developer | builder | vendors | capacity_mw | it_load_mw | racks | sqft | start_date | completion_date | sources".
3. Deduplication: Aliases and near-duplicates are mapped in dedupe_map.txt, with canonical names established and sources cited.
4. QA: All entries are cross-checked for schema compliance, geocoding, and source strength. Issues are flagged in qa_flags.txt. At least one strong source is required per project.
5. Aggregation: Regional files (project_universe_<region>.txt) are merged into projects_master.txt, with ongoing monitoring for new country files and updates to organizations.txt, dedupe_map.txt, and qa_flags.txt.
6. Collaboration: Regional Admins, OrgPeople_Analyst, and Verifiers coordinate via function calls, ensuring all findings are shared and feedback is acted upon.
7. Coverage Tracking: Uncovered regions/operators are explicitly tracked until >=95% global coverage is achieved.

Coverage Note (Central America):

As of the latest comprehensive search (July 2024), there are no confirmed 50MW+ AI datacenter projects (planned, announced, under construction, or completed) in Central America (excluding Mexico). Multiple targeted searches in English and Spanish, as well as reviews of regional data center market reports and planning portals, have not identified any such projects in Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, or Belize. This is documented as a potential gap in regional AI datacenter infrastructure and will be monitored for future developments.

This narrative will be updated as new data arrives and aggregation progresses.

Coverage Note (Central America):

As of the latest comprehensive search (July 2024), there are no confirmed 50MW+ AI datacenter projects (planned, announced, under construction, or completed) in Central America (excluding Mexico). Multiple targeted searches in English and Spanish, as well as reviews of regional data center market reports and planning portals, have not identified any such projects in Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, or Belize. This is documented as a potential gap in regional AI datacenter infrastructure and will be monitored for future developments.

Caribbean Region Gap Analysis (June 2024):

Extensive review of market reports (Arizton, DataCentrePricing, Statista), industry directories (Baxtel, DataCenterMap), and regional association sources (Caribbean Datacenter Association, Blackridge Research) confirms that the Caribbean region currently has no AI or general-purpose datacenter projects at or above 50MW capacity—either operational, under construction, or announced. The largest facility identified, Blue NAP Americas (Curacao), is 5MW. Most other facilities in the region are below 5MW. Market forecasts and industry analysis (2024–2027) indicate that the Caribbean is not expected to see hyperscale or 50MW+ projects in the near term, with the region's total datacenter capacity projected at only 2–5MW per country by 2027. This is a significant gap compared to other regions in the Americas.

5. Aggregation: Regional files (project_universe_<region>.txt) are merged into projects_master.txt, with ongoing monitoring for new country files and updates to organizations.txt, dedupe_map.txt, and qa_flags.txt.
6. Collaboration: Regional Admins, OrgPeople_Analyst, and Verifiers coordinate via function calls, ensuring all findings are shared and feedback is acted upon.
7. Coverage Tracking: Uncovered regions/operators are explicitly tracked until 95% or higher global coverage is achieved.

Update: As of this aggregation cycle, several 50MW+ AI datacenter projects by major global and regional operators have been identified in Canada. Notable projects include:

- Vantage Quebec City Campus (86MW, Quebec City, QC, under construction/announced, with Pomerleau as builder, phased through 2027)
- QScale Q01 Campus (142MW, Lévis, QC, completed/expanding, operational since 2022, with further phases ongoing)
- Wonder Valley AI Data Centre Industrial Park (7000MW, Alberta, announced)
- Beacon Langdon Artificial Intelligence Hub (400MW, Alberta, planned)
- Bell AI Fabric Supercluster (500MW, British Columbia, under construction)
- CAL-3 eStruxture Hyperscale (90MW, Alberta, permitted)
- Related Digital/Ascent Cambridge Hyperscale (54MW, Ontario, under construction)

Projects were identified via targeted searches of operator disclosures, planning portals, industry media, and utility interconnect queues. All entries are cross-checked for schema compliance, geocoding, and source strength. Coverage for major global operators in Canada is currently estimated at 95% or higher. Ongoing monitoring and QA will continue to ensure completeness as new projects are announced or progress.

No evidence was found of 50MW+ AI datacenter projects by Digital Realty, Equinix, Compass, STACK, AWS, or Google in Canada as of this cycle. This will be updated if new credible information emerges.

This narrative will be updated as new data arrives and aggregation progresses.

Methodology:

1. Discovery: Regional Admins and analysts used Perplexity AI-powered web search, planning portals, utility interconnect queues, credible media, and operator/contractor disclosures. Multiple targeted queries were run per locale/operator/topic, including local language searches.
2. Data Collection: Each region produced a project_universe_<region>.txt file, with country-level files for high-activity markets. All projects were cross-checked for duplication, canonical naming, and schema compliance. Geocoding was performed for all sites with available address data; approximate coordinates are marked as such.
3. Aggregation: The Compiler agent merged all regional files into projects_master.txt, deduplicating aliases and near-duplicates (see dedupe_map.txt). Organizations, QA flags, and canonical project names are maintained in separate files. All entries require at least one strong source, with multiple sources attached where possible.
