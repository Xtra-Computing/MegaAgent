Content: ## India is actively promoting AI adoption through initiatives like the IndiaAI mission

India is rapidly emerging as a global hub for artificial intelligence (AI) development. As the demand for compute power and AI model training increases, hyperscale data centers are becoming central to India’s digital infrastructure. These facilities not only support AI startups and research institutions in the country but also power cloud services and government-backed initiatives that require massive GPU clusters and high-speed data processing.

With the Indian government actively promoting AI adoption through initiatives like the IndiaAI mission, and private investment pouring into digital infrastructure, a new generation of AI-ready data centers is taking shape in the Asian nation.

Below, we explore five of the most notable AI-focused data center projects currently reshaping India’s technological landscape.

Content: India’s government is pledging billions in financial support for the country’s ambitions around artificial intelligence (AI), and a Mumbai-headquartered energy group has said it plans to build what it calls the “world’s largest” data center in Jamnagar.

Reliance Industries, led by Mukesh Ambani, a billionaire and the company’s chairman, already has a partnership with California-based technology group Nvidia. The companies last year said they would collaborate in an effort to develop AI supercomputers in India. They plan to jointly build AI infrastructure in the country, and Nvidia last year said it would provide its Blackwell AI processors for a reported 3-GW data center that would be built by Reliance.

Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO who spoke with

*POWER* at meeting last summer in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the time of last year’s deal said, “It makes complete sense that India should manufacture its own AI. You should not export data to import intelligence. India should not export flour to import bread.” Nvidia al...

Title: Attracting AI Data Centre Infrastructure Investment in India
URL: https://www.deloitte.com/in/en/issues/generative-ai/data-centre-infrastructure.html
Content: As global Artificial Intelligence (AI) growth and domestic ambitions converge, India stands at a critical inflection point. Worldwide, AI adoption continues to surge. India, too, is riding this digital wave. Poised to become one of the fastest-growing leaders in AI, India’s AI market is expected to reach US$20–22 billion by 2027, posting a CAGR of 30 percent.

However, despite hosting nearly 20 percent of the world’s data, India has just 3 percent of the global data centre capacity. The gap between India’s AI aspirations and compute infrastructure presents a strategic opportunity and a national imperative to build AI data centres at scale. Given the rising demand, India must boost its AI-ready infrastructure.

India’s AI future is bright. Today’s investments will cement India’s long-term leadership in AI. By addressing these challenges, India can convert perceived gaps into advantages. For India to accelerate its AI capabilities and reach its development potential, there is a need to introduce enabling polici...

Content: Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance is planning to build what could become the world’s largest data center in Jamnagar, India, with a capacity of 3 gigawatts to capitalize on surging AI demand.

The facility would dwarf the current largest data center, Microsoft’s 600-megawatt site in Virginia, Bloomberg reported Friday. The project could cost between $20 billion and $30 billion, the report added.

In 2020, Ambani raised more than $25 billion from a group of investors, including Meta, Google, Silver Lake, General Atlantic, KKR, Mubadala, and PIF to fund the growth of Reliance’s retail and telecom ventures that now dominate the country. Reliance is India’s most valuable company.

Ambani aims to power the facility primarily with renewable energy from an adjacent green energy complex that will produce solar, wind, and hydrogen power.

Nvidia is selling Ambani chips for the data center, the report added. Nvidia and Reliance announced a partnership to build infrastructure for AI applications in India in October.

Content: Sify Infinit Spaces has broken ground on a data center in Lucknow, India.

A subsidiary of Sify Technologies, the company said its facility will be built in four phases with Phase I becoming operational in June 2025.

The data center is located in the HCL IT city campus on Sultanpur Road, but other specifications and details have not been shared.

The site is likely part of Sify’s previously announced plan to build smaller Edge AI inference facilities across 20 secondary markets in India.

“We are pleased to enable Lucknow to join the list of AI-ready cities. This facility is in line with our aggressive investment goals and is also a testament to the state government's ambition of making Uttar Pradesh the data center destination for North India. Sify is pleased to help enable that ambition into a reality,” said Raju Vegesna, chairman of Sify Technologies.

Content: Sify Technologies has announced it will invest $5 billion in expanding its data centers and integrating artificial intelligence operations in India.

As announced in a recent LinkedIn post, the company plans to build smaller AI inference facilities across 20 secondary markets in India.

Further details have not yet been disclosed.

The ICT solutions provider launched a GPU cloud offering in October last year. Its CloudInfinit+AI solution gives users access to GPUs on a pay-as-you-go-basis.

The GPUs are likely from Nvidia following the announcement in September 2024 that Sify would become a Nvidia colocation partner.

In June 2023, Kotak Data Center Fund said it would invest up to Rs 6 billion ($73m) in compulsory convertible debentures of Sify Technologies’ data center unit. The funds were said to be for data center expansion across India and as an investment into renewable energy.
