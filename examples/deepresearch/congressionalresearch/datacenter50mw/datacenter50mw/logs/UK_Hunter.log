URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/london-data-center-campus-havering-hydrogen-fuel-cell/
Content: The developers behind a massive 600MW data center campus being planned for east London, UK, say it could house a hydrogen fuel cell energy generation plant.

Digital Reef is planning to build the campus on a 175-acre Green Belt site on Dunnings Lane and Fen Road in the London borough of Havering. First proposed in 2022, it would comprise 12 buildings and cost £5.3 billion ($5.97bn) to build. The scheme could see over 1,200 jobs created in Havering.

The campus has yet to receive planning approval and has faced opposition from residents and environmental campaigners.

When the scheme was first announced, Digital Reef claimed it was developing a “zero carbon facility,” and in a project update delivered to Havering Borough Council last month, it revealed details of some of the measures it plans to put in place to keep the site’s carbon footprint down.

The campus will house a 64,000 sq ft (6,000 sqm) hydrogen fuel cell energy generation plant. These fuel cells are able to take hydrogen and combine it with air to...

Title: 175-hectare, 600MW data center campus proposed outside London in Havering
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/175-hectare-600mw-data-center-campus-proposed-outside-london-in-havering/
Content: A massive new data center campus is being proposed in the eastern London Borough of Havering.

Havering Council this week said it has been in negotiations with a private sector developer, Digital Reef, to build ‘Europe’s largest data center’ on a site of 175 hectares in the east of Havering, some 15 miles from east London’s established Docklands data center pocket.

The £5.3 billion ($5.97bn) ‘London Data Freeport’ project would reportedly include developing a “Zero Carbon facility” on the corner of Fen Lane and Dunnings Lane on land crossing North Ockendon and Upminster. The site is currently designated as green belt land.

The application filings say the project could be “a cornerstone” of the UK Government’s new focus on sovereign data. No other mention of potential customers is included in the application.

Located close to the Warley Substation, the proposed campus will consist of ten 50MW and five 20MW units, collectively supporting 600MW of capacity. The project would total around 330,000 sqm (3.55 mil...

The Vantage Newport data centre campus is one of the largest in both the UK and Europe, with two operational buildings and a third still to come, planned to provide nearly 150MW of capacity.

Originally opened as Next Generation Data (NGD) in 2009 and acquired by Vantage in July 2020, this is one of the longest running “hyperscale” campuses in the UK. The majority of capacity is sold to Microsoft and the site is an Azure Express Route location. However, dedicated halls for “smaller clients” such as British Telecom, IBM or Wipro are an option. Retail colocation rack space is available through Colo-X partners, including quarter and half racks. LINX, London Internet Exchange opened here in 2020 but only 8 ports in use by 2024.

Within the UK this is one of only two wholesale focussed campuses away from London and the M25, so offers diversity at scale, as well as servicing the needs of the smaller local market from south Wales or the Bristol/south-west Engla...

## Did you know?

## You can read this and more in the magazine

Britain is ramping up its commitment to AI, but this time with a sharpened focus on the infrastructure that supports it, particularly data centres.

Through its AI Growth Zones initiative, the UK Government is making data centres central to its strategy for cementing the country’s status as a global AI leader.

By targeting key regions outside the capital, the plan aims to create regional engines for both AI development and economic renewal.

## Building an AI future through infrastructure

The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology has launched the qualifying process for its AI Growth Zones, a flagship element of the wider AI Opportunities Action Plan.

The UK Government intends for these zones to become hotbeds for machine learning research, large language model (LLM) development and the commercialisation of AI technologies.

At the core of the proposal is a recognition that ...

Content: At the same time, a data center proposal in the north-east London borough of Havering – a 175-hectare, 600 MW campus that would be the largest in Europe – had yet to complete its arduous journey through the planning process at the time of writing.“Our data shows a willingness from local authorities to invest and support data centers, with many already aligned with the government’s strategy to ride the wave of AI to supercharge economic growth and productivity,” said Matt Salter, data center director at Onnec.

But is it genuinely easy to navigate a data center proposal through the UK’s notorious planning process?

Content: The government is on a mission to make the UK an artificial intelligence (AI) superpower, by accelerating the adoption of the technology across the public and private sectors to supercharge the economy.
According to the government, embracing AI will generate efficiencies in the way that businesses and public sector organisations operate, but achieving this will require the UK to develop the homegrown datacentre infrastructure needed to host compute-intensive AI workloads.
To this point, the government outlined a commitment in January 2025 – following the publication of its AI opportunities action plan – to expand the UK's sovereign compute capacity by at least 20-fold by 2030. And this is where the government's AI Growth Zones strategy comes into play, which was another of the standout inclusions in the Action Plan.
But what are AI Growth Zones? And how are they expected to help the UK government achieve its AI-focused aims and objectives?
According to the government, AI Growth Zones are designated sites that...

All 50 recommendations set out in the Plan have been adopted by the government with promised delivery timelines.

To drive the government’s goal of building sufficient, secure and sustainable data infrastructure, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology will publish a long-term plan for the UK’s AI infrastructure needs and is committed to setting out a 10-year roadmap. While specific details remain under wraps, key focus areas are expected to include (i) addressing security concerns, (ii) sustainability and energy, (iii) supply chain resilience and (iv) the pursuit of sovereign AI compute—public-sector-owned or allocated infrastructure to ensure national capability and strategic independence.

Kao Data’s Chief Commercial Officer, Spencer Lamb, announced its strategic plans to expand its footprint to Greater Manchester and the broader North West region at Connected North 2025 Data Centre Summit in Manchester.

These areas will support international data transmission by providing a combination of accessible power resources, available land and secure subsea cable connectivity.

Spencer points to the fact that between 90% and 95% of the UK’s total data centre capacity is in West London, meaning the area has become hampered by limited available land space for new developments and severe power shortages.

This can make it challenging to meet the rising demand of the government, enterprise and hyperscaler customers as it has led to a bottleneck where new capacity is hard to bring online.

Regarding the expansion into Greater Manchester, Spencer emphasises the need to: “do something use...

Title: Data center projects worth £14bn announced with new UK government AI plan
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/uk-ai-opportunities-action-plan-data-center/
Content: Data center projects worth £14 billion ($16.96bn) have been announced as part of a new AI action plan launched by the UK government.

The plan proposes creating AI growth zones to help encourage data center developments and pledges to build a new supercomputer to boost UK compute power.

Alongside these government-driven initiatives, businesses Vantage, Nscale, and Kyndryl have all committed to invest in UK digital infrastructure, and the projects will create 13,250 jobs, Downing Street said.... ## The UK’s AI Opportunities Action Plan

The plan is based on 50 recommendations from Matt Clifford, the founder of startup incubator Entrepreneur First and chair of the government’s Advanced Research and Innovation Agency.

Clifford was commissioned to work on the plan after the July 2024 UK general election, and the government has said it will adopt all 50 recommendations.

The plan has three pillars, the first of which, “laying the foundations for AI to flourish in the UK,” relates to digital infrastructure.

Title: London calling: The outlook for the UK's data center market in 2025
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/london-data-center-market-2025-uk-angela-rayner/
Content: Six months into its tenure, the UK's new Labour government has shown that, when it comes to data centers at least, it means business.

Earlier this month, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner overruled local planning concerns and gave the go-ahead for the development of a 140MW campus at the Court Lane Industrial Estate in Iver, Buckinghamshire.

The data center had been blocked by Buckinghamshire Council last year as an “inappropriate development on green belt land,” but following a public inquiry, Rayner has given it the thumbs up, stating in a letter that the site “would make a significant contribution” to the UK's data center needs.

Rayner is making good on a promise Labour made when it arrived in office to take a more flexible approach to building digital infrastructure on Green Belt land. At the time of writing a verdict is being awaited in the case of another rejected data center, a 96MW development in Abbot’s Langley, Hertfordshire, that was rejected in January. A public inquiry into this decision end...

Content: Keep reading for an update about the proposals for a new Data 
Centre at Court Lane and restoration of Iver Court Farmhouse. 
  
We are getting back in touch about Affinius Capital (previously named USAA Real 
Estate) and Corscale Data Centers’ proposals for an industry-leading data centre 
and restoration of the historic Iver Court Farmhouse (PL/22/4145/OA & 
PL/22/4398/HB). We wanted to provide an update on the plans and invite you to 
meet with the team to discuss the plans further. We’re particularly keen to 
understand your thoughts on how Section 106 contributions associated with the 
development could benefit the local area. 
As a reminder, the planning applications (one outline application for the 
development and one listed building application for the refurbishment of Iver 
Court Farmhouse) were submitted in late 2022. The plans make more efficient 
use of previously developed land, which has been allocated for employment use,

and address the increasing demand for data centres, whilst delivering a ...

Title: Vision
URL: https://court-lane.com/vision/
Content: Once operational, a data centre at Court Lane will require approximately

**90 highly skilled** workers on site, generating an estimated local impact of **£12 million** gross value added per year. Additionally, the plans would create around 171 non-tradeable local service jobs, generating around **£3 million** of gross value added per year to the local economy.

The plans will combine cutting edge technology with architecture shaped by the heritage of the area, including the refurbishment of the Farmhouse on the site. We aim to deliver an attractive new data centre inspired by this building, representing an innovative approach to data centre design. The images and video fly-through below show the style of architecture that the team is proposing, such as terracotta and timber, in keeping with the local context.

Title: Data Centre Construction Projects: The Surge in the UK
URL: https://barbour-abi.com/whats-driving-the-surge-in-data-centre-construction-projects-in-the-uk/
Content: As AI becomes an undeniable integration in our everyday lives, it’s also a major factor in driving the surge of Data Centre construction projects in the UK. The UK’s digital infrastructure is relying on more data centres to be built to store and manage data. However, where there is a rise in the demand of building more data centres, there’s also the expected spike in energy usage that must be addressed.

According to Pulsant, producing Chat GPT-3 alone produced the same amount of emissions produced by 123 gasoline-powered cars driven for a year.

Chief executive of the National Grid, John Pettigrew, has said that data centre power usage would increase six-fold in the next decade. This increase has been attributed to AI and quantum computing and will eventually cause strain on the grid if proper infrastructure isn’t delivered on time. Currently, data centres utilise nearly 1% of total UK electricity use.

The strain on the grid isn’t the only concern for this growing sector. Data Centres will have to adapt to ...

Title: Data center projects worth £14bn announced with new UK government AI plan
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/uk-ai-opportunities-action-plan-data-center/
Content: Data center projects worth £14 billion ($16.96bn) have been announced as part of a new AI action plan launched by the UK government.

The plan proposes creating AI growth zones to help encourage data center developments and pledges to build a new supercomputer to boost UK compute power.

Alongside these government-driven initiatives, businesses Vantage, Nscale, and Kyndryl have all committed to invest in UK digital infrastructure, and the projects will create 13,250 jobs, Downing Street said.... ## The UK’s AI Opportunities Action Plan

The plan is based on 50 recommendations from Matt Clifford, the founder of startup incubator Entrepreneur First and chair of the government’s Advanced Research and Innovation Agency.

Clifford was commissioned to work on the plan after the July 2024 UK general election, and the government has said it will adopt all 50 recommendations.

The plan has three pillars, the first of which, “laying the foundations for AI to flourish in the UK,” relates to digital infrastructure.

Title: UK government pledges 500MW of data center power for its AI Growth Zones
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/uk-ai-growth-zones-data-center/
Content: The UK government says it will work with power companies to make up to 500MW of electricity available for new data center developments in each of its planned AI growth zones.

Regions across the UK were this week invited to bid to host the growth zones, announced earlier this year as part of the government's AI Opportunities Action Plan.

They aim to create areas with favorable conditions for building AI infrastructure, with streamlined planning rules to enable developments to be approved quickly, and a sufficient supply of power.

As part of its announcement on the bidding process, the Department of Science and Technology (DSIT) said “the government will work with network operators to rapidly scale each zone to 500MW+, enough to power roughly two million homes.”

The announcement also said priority will be given to “sites with large existing power connections (with a current capacity of 500+ MW),” suggesting ministers are more keen to lean on existing capacity than finding new sources of energy to boost Brit...

Title: UK Data Centre Growth 2025
URL: https://visibuild.com/uk-data-centre/
Content: While the world obsesses over AI breakthroughs and cloud innovation, a quieter, but no less critical, transformation is happening across the UK.

**Data centres** are fast becoming one of the most in-demand, high-spec, and high-pressure projects in modern construction.

Behind every AI-powered chatbot, banking transaction, public cloud app, and NHS login sits a

**data centre facility**. Or ten. And across the country, we’re seeing unprecedented momentum in **data centre construction, **fuelled by demand for speed, storage, security, and scale.

**A Surge in Demand – and a Race to Deliver**

According to the UK Government’s

**National Data Strategy** and recent market forecasts, **UK data usage** is expected to double by 2026. London remains one of Europe’s largest **modern data center** hubs, but growth is accelerating across the South East, Manchester, and other regions, driven by the rise of **edge computing**, **AI data centres**, and **cloud services**.

So,

Since the 2024 UK general election, artificial intelligence (AI) has been a top priority on the government’s agenda. The King’s Speech in July 2024 signaled a cautious approach, focusing on AI regulation and safety, but by October, the government had made sweeping announcements of foreign investment in data centers at the UK’s International Investment Summit. The government has since introduced incremental policy developments addressing data center planning and expansion. This momentum continued into 2025, with the release of the government’s AI Opportunities Action Plan (the Plan), published on January 13, 2025, detailing new initiatives and strategic direction.

The Plan recommends a range of policies and actions for the government to take as part of its overarching aspiration to kickstart broad-based economic growth. The Plan commits to three goals:

The first of these goals is the most dominant section in the Plan—capturing 30 of the 50 total recommendations. This s...

The UK’s digital infrastructure is relying on more data centres to be built to store and manage data. However, where there is a rise in the demand of building more data centres, there’s also the expected spike in energy usage that must be addressed.\n\nAccording to Pulsant, producing Chat GPT-3 alone produced the same amount of emissions produced by 123 gasoline-powered cars driven for a year.\n\nChief executive of the National Grid, John Pettigrew, has said that data centre power usage would increase six-fold in the next decade. This increase has been attributed to AI and quantum computing and will eventually cause strain on the grid if proper infrastructure isn’t delivered on time. Currently, data centres utilise nearly 1% of total UK electricity use.\n\nThe strain on the grid isn’t the only concern for this growing sector. Data Centres will have to adapt to ...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 2:\nTitle: Data center projects worth £14bn announced with new UK government AI plan\nURL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/uk-ai-opportunities-action-plan-data-center/\nContent: Data center projects worth £14 billion ($16.96bn) have been announced as part of a new AI action plan launched by the UK government.\n\nThe plan proposes creating AI growth zones to help encourage data center developments and pledges to build a new supercomputer to boost UK compute power.\n\nAlongside these government-driven initiatives, businesses Vantage, Nscale, and Kyndryl have all committed to invest in UK digital infrastructure, and the projects will create 13,250 jobs, Downing Street said.... ## The UK’s AI Opportunities Action Plan\n\nThe plan is based on 50 recommendations from Matt Clifford, the founder of startup incubator Entrepreneur First and chair of the government’s Advanced Research and Innovation Agency.\n\nClifford was commissioned to work on the plan after the July 2024 UK general election, and the government has said it will adopt all 50 recommendations.\n\nThe plan has three pillars, the first of which, “laying the foundations for AI to flourish in the UK,” relates to digital infrastructure.\n\nAs p...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 3:\nTitle: UK government pledges 500MW of data center power for its AI Growth Zones\nURL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/uk-ai-growth-zones-data-center/\nContent: The UK government says it will work with power companies to make up to 500MW of electricity available for new data center developments in each of its planned AI growth zones.\n\nRegions across the UK were this week invited to bid to host the growth zones, announced earlier this year as part of the government\'s AI Opportunities Action Plan.\n\nThey aim to create areas with favorable conditions for building AI infrastructure, with streamlined planning rules to enable developments to be approved quickly, and a sufficient supply of power.\n\nAs part of its announcement on the bidding process, the Department of Science and Technology (DSIT) said “the government will work with network operators to rapidly scale each zone to 500MW+, enough to power roughly two million homes.”\n\nThe announcement also said priority will be given to “sites with large existing power connections (with a current capacity of 500+ MW),” suggesting ministers are more keen to lean on existing capacity than finding new sources of energy to boost Brit...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 4:\nTitle: UK Data Centre Growth 2025\nURL: https://visibuild.com/uk-data-centre/\nContent: While the world obsesses over AI breakthroughs and cloud innovation, a quieter, but no less critical, transformation is happening across the UK.\n\n**Data centres** are fast becoming one of the most in-demand, high-spec, and high-pressure projects in modern construction.\n\nBehind every AI-powered chatbot, banking transaction, public cloud app, and NHS login sits a\n\n**data centre facility**.
