URL: https://www.avisenlegal.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-develop-a-data-center-a-step-by-step-timeline/
Content: **Challenges:**

- Limited availability of suitable sites in high-demand areas.

- Navigating complex energy infrastructure requirements.

**Timeline:**

Site selection typically takes

**6-12 months**, but the process may extend if local regulations are complex or suitable sites are scarce. Working with Avisen Legal early can help accelerate your timeline.

**Phase 2: Data Center Permitting and Approvals Timeline (6–18 Months)**

Once a site is selected, the necessary permits and approvals need to be obtained. This phase involves navigating local, state, and sometimes federal regulatory requirements. All of these permitting processes require experienced legal counsel, like the energy law team at Avisen, to help you navigate these complex requirements and to help you understand how they all interconnect and lead to your project’s success.

**Key Permits and Approvals:** **Environmental Permits:**Compliance with environmental regulations and impact assessments. **Zoning Approvals:**Ensuring the site is zoned a...

Executive Summary:

This project aims to comprehensively identify and document essentially every (>=95% coverage) AI datacenter project worldwide with a capacity of 50MW or greater. The scope includes planned, announced, permitted, under construction, and completed projects. For each project, we capture the exact location, status, involved organizations and individuals (owner/operator, developer, EPC/builder, key vendors), size/specs (capacity MW, IT load MW, racks, floor area), key dates, and sources. The aggregation process is ongoing, with regional admins for Americas, EMEA, and APAC actively compiling and QA'ing their respective project universes. Supporting files for organizations, deduplication, and QA are also being maintained.

Methodology:

1. Discovery: Regional Admins use targeted web and planning portal searches, utility interconnect queues, credible media, and corporate/contractor disclosures to identify projects. Multiple queries per locale/operator/topic, including local languages, are used to maximize coverage.
2. Data Capture: Each project is recorded in a standardized schema: "project_name | status | country | region | city | site_address | latitude | longitude | operator | developer | builder | vendors | capacity_mw | it_load_mw | racks | sqft | start_date | completion_date | sources".
3. Deduplication: Aliases and near-duplicates are mapped in dedupe_map.txt, with canonical names established and sources cited.
4. QA: All entries are cross-checked for schema compliance, geocoding, and source strength. Issues are flagged in qa_flags.txt. At least one strong source is required per project.
5. Aggregation: Regional files (project_universe_<region>.txt) are merged into projects_master.txt, with ongoing monitoring for new country files and updates to organizations.txt, dedupe_map.txt, and qa_flags.txt.
6. Collaboration: Regional Admins, OrgPeople_Analyst, and Verifiers coordinate via function calls, ensuring all findings are shared and feedback is acted upon.
7. Coverage Tracking: Uncovered regions/operators are explicitly tracked until >=95% global coverage is achieved.

Coverage Note (Central America):

As of the latest comprehensive search (July 2024), there are no confirmed 50MW+ AI datacenter projects (planned, announced, under construction, or completed) in Central America (excluding Mexico). Multiple targeted searches in English and Spanish, as well as reviews of regional data center market reports and planning portals, have not identified any such projects in Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, or Belize. This is documented as a potential gap in regional AI datacenter infrastructure and will be monitored for future developments.

This narrative will be updated as new data arrives and aggregation progresses.
