Content: Recent research studies have raised concerns about the high electricity consumption required—and expected to increase—for data processing centers used by artificial intelligence (AI) applications. This demand is linked to algorithm training, query processing, and server cooling systems.

It is estimated that there are around 7,000 AI-related data centers worldwide, with an annual electricity consumption of approximately 350 TWh, indicating an average annual consumption of about 50 GWh per data center. Other studies suggest that by 2030, the number of such centers will increase by 165% compared to 2023, representing an average annual growth rate of 15%.

In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), there are currently 455 AI data centers. Based on the global average energy consumption per center, in 2023, AI-related electricity use accounted for 1.6% of the region’s total electricity consumption. Taking into account the projected growth in both total electricity consumption in LAC and the expected increase in the...

Content: ## Data in the Clouds, Centers on the Ground: The Role of Data Centers in LAC’s Digital Future... Within LAC, digital infrastructure is concentrated in just a handful of countries (Figure 2) and are mostly privately owned and backed by US investment groups. Brazil alone hosts 37.2% of the region’s data centers and the only 2 hyperscalers in LAC, followed by Chile (13.4%), Mexico (12.3%), Colombia (8.4%), and Argentina (6.8%). Together, they possess over 78% of the region’s data centers, giving them a strategic edge in AI adoption and digital innovation. In contrast, Peru and Panama each account for just 3.1% of the region’s data centers.

Content: ###### April 15, 2025

Data centers, a key component of digital economies, are gaining prominence as demand surges for cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and 5G networks. These physical facilities are where organizations store, manage, and process large volumes of digital data, ensuring secure and efficient access. They house servers and networking infrastructure, supporting essential services like website hosting, email, media streaming, and financial transactions. In essence, data centers are where digital data lives.

Their role has become even more crucial with the explosive growth of AI, which relies on data centers to train and run complex models. As a result, global demand for data centers is projected to grow between 19% and 22% every year through 2030, an opportunity that does not come without costs. This #GraphForThought uses data from the Data Center Map -a database tracking data center locations worldwide- to explore how Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is responding to this trend...

Caribbean Region Gap Analysis (June 2024):

Extensive review of market reports (Arizton, DataCentrePricing, Statista), industry directories (Baxtel, DataCenterMap), and regional association sources (Caribbean Datacenter Association, Blackridge Research) confirms that the Caribbean region currently has no AI or general-purpose datacenter projects at or above 50MW capacity—either operational, under construction, or announced. The largest facility identified, Blue NAP Americas (Curacao), is 5MW. Most other facilities in the region are below 5MW. Market forecasts and industry analysis (2024–2027) indicate that the Caribbean is not expected to see hyperscale or 50MW+ projects in the near term, with the region's total datacenter capacity projected at only 2–5MW per country by 2027. This is a significant gap compared to other regions in the Americas.

Coverage Note (Central America):

As of the latest comprehensive search (July 2024), there are no confirmed 50MW+ AI datacenter projects (planned, announced, under construction, or completed) in Central America (excluding Mexico). Multiple targeted searches in English and Spanish, as well as reviews of regional data center market reports and planning portals, have not identified any such projects in Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, or Belize.

---Content---
Executive Summary:

This project aims to comprehensively identify and document essentially every (>=95% coverage) AI datacenter project worldwide with a capacity of 50MW or greater. The scope includes planned, announced, permitted, under construction, and completed projects. For each project, we capture the exact location, status, involved organizations and individuals (owner/operator, developer, EPC/builder, key vendors), size/specs (capacity MW, IT load MW, racks, floor area), key dates, and sources. The aggregation process is ongoing, with regional admins for Americas, EMEA, and APAC actively compiling and QA'ing their respective project universes. Supporting files for organizations, deduplication, and QA are also being maintained.

Methodology:

1. Discovery: Regional Admins use targeted web and planning portal searches, utility interconnect queues, credible media, and corporate/contractor disclosures to identify projects. Multiple queries per locale/operator/topic, including local languages, are used to maximize coverage.
2. Data Capture: Each project is recorded in a standardized schema: "project_name | status | country | region | city | site_address | latitude | longitude | operator | developer | builder | vendors | capacity_mw | it_load_mw | racks | sqft | start_date | completion_date | sources".
3. Deduplication: Aliases and near-duplicates are mapped in dedupe_map.txt, with canonical names established and sources cited.
4. QA: All entries are cross-checked for schema compliance, geocoding, and source strength. Issues are flagged in qa_flags.txt. At least one strong source is required per project.
5. Aggregation: Regional files (project_universe_<region>.txt) are merged into projects_master.txt, with ongoing monitoring for new country files and updates to organizations.txt, dedupe_map.txt, and qa_flags.txt.
6. Collaboration: Regional Admins, OrgPeople_Analyst, and Verifiers coordinate via function calls, ensuring all findings are shared and feedback is acted upon.
7. Coverage Tracking: Uncovered regions/operators are explicitly tracked until >=95% global coverage is achieved.

Coverage Note (Central America):

As of the latest comprehensive search (July 2024), there are no confirmed 50MW+ AI datacenter projects (planned, announced, under construction, or completed) in Central America (excluding Mexico). Multiple targeted searches in English and Spanish, as well as reviews of regional data center market reports and planning portals, have not identified any such projects in Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, or Belize. This is documented as a potential gap in regional AI datacenter infrastructure and will be monitored for future developments.

Caribbean Region Gap Analysis (June 2024):

Extensive review of market reports (Arizton, DataCentrePricing, Statista), industry directories (Baxtel, DataCenterMap), and regional association sources (Caribbean Datacenter Association, Blackridge Research) confirms that the Caribbean region currently has no AI or general-purpose datacenter projects at or above 50MW capacity—either operational, under construction, or announced. The largest facility identified, Blue NAP Americas (Curacao), is 5MW. Most other facilities in the region are below 5MW. Market forecasts and industry analysis (2024–2027) indicate that the Caribbean is not expected to see hyperscale or 50MW+ projects in the near term, with the region's total datacenter capacity projected at only 2–5MW per country by 2027. This is a significant gap compared to other regions in the Americas.
