The Beacon Langdon Artificial Intelligence Hub is a proposed 946-acre data center campus located east of Calgary, Alberta, near the hamlet of Indus. This ambitious project, led by Beacon Data Centers, aims to establish a 400MW AI-driven facility with on-site power generation capacity.

The hub is strategically positioned close to three electrical substations—Enmax 65, Langdon, and Shepherd—to ensure efficient energy access. Additionally, the development will integrate a solar farm, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable energy solutions.

Beacon AI Centers has secured over 1,600 acres of land across Alberta, with plans to develop multiple AI hubs totaling 1.8GW of capacity, with the first buildings expected to go live in...

ASP Draft

On April 15, 2025, the project team hosted an open house at the Indus Recreational Centre. Staff from Rocky View County and the Beacon Data Center were in attendance to answer questions and provide information on the proposed area structure plan. A draft of The Beacon AI Hub ASP is available for review. Please refer to the following link below for a copy of the draft:

Opportunities to ask questions and provide feedback

Next Steps

The ASP will be presented at a public hearing on June 17th. The project team continues to refine the draft Plan. If there are questions about the proposed ASP or the project, please contact planning_policy@rockyview.ca.

The County is reviewing the development of an artificial intelligence hub through the creation of the Beacon AI Hub Area Structure Plan (ASP). In August 2024, Stantec Consulting on behalf of Beacon Data Centers Inc, submitted...

Content: Canadian data center operator eStruxture is to build a new facility in Calgary, Alberta.

The company this week announced plans to invest more than CA$750 million (US$540.2m) to build CAL-3, a new 90MW data center.

Slated to go live in the Fall of 2026, the data center will be located in Rocky View County, just north of Calgary. CAL-3 will be a Tier III data center able to offer rack densities of up to 125kW across multiple customizable data halls.

The company said the facility would be Alberta’s largest data center, driven by “unprecedented” demand from AI and cloud providers.

Todd Coleman, founder, president, and CEO of eStruxture, said: “CAL-3 is a significant, strategic investment, not only for eStruxture but for Alberta’s rapidly evolving digital and AI landscape.
