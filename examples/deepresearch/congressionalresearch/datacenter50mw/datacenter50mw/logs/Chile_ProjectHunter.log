Every time someone runs a query on Search, watches a video on YouTube, looks up directions on Google Maps, or uses Gmail for work or school, there's a data center behind the scenes making it all possible. We live in an era in which digital communication and access to information are foundational to the growth and development of countries and the people who live in them. That’s why we opened a data center in Chile in 2015 — to improve the connectivity of our users and the performance of our services. Today, after dedicated planning and analysis, we are taking another step forward with the construction of a second data center in Latin America, this time in Canelones, Uruguay.

We’re investing more than $850 million USD in the new data center, which will bring greater connectivity across the region, help boost the development of governments, businesses and communities — while improving access to the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI).

Content: SANTIAGO, Chile — Google on Tuesday said it would halt plans to develop a major $200 million data center in Chile to address environmental concerns, a decision reflecting growing worries about the impact of power-thirsty projects around the world.

The U.S. technology company first obtained permits in 2020 to construct the vast project in Chile's capital, Santiago, as demand for server farms skyrocketed across the globe, fueled by a surge in cloud-based technologies and a craze for generative AI.

But months after a Chilean court partially reversed the center's authorization over water usage concerns, Google announced Tuesday that it would revise the project to comply with more stringent environmental requirements and change its water-intensive cooling system.

"A new process will start from scratch," Google said in its statement. "Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do, and the way we design and manage our data centers is no exception."

Title: Google halts plan for $200 million data center in Chile amid concerns over AI-driven power demands
URL: https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/google-ai-artificial-intelligence-data-center-chile
Content: SANTIAGO, Chile — Google on Tuesday said it would halt plans to develop a major $200 million data center in Chile to address environmental concerns, a decision reflecting growing worries about the impact of power-thirsty projects around the world.
The U.S. technology company first obtained permits in 2020 to construct the vast project in Chile's capital, Santiago, as demand for server farms skyrocketed across the globe, fueled by a surge in cloud-based technologies and a craze for generative AI.
But months after a Chilean court partially reversed the center's authorization over water usage concerns, Google announced Tuesday that it would revise the project to comply with more stringent environmental requirements and change its water-intensive cooling system.
"A new process will start from scratch," Google said in its statement. "Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do, and the way we design and manage our data centers is no exception."

Content: Google plans to expand its only Latin American data center with a $140m investment that will triple the size of the campus in Chile to 11.2 hectares (27.7 acres).

A launch event for the expansion was attended by Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, underscoring the importance of the project for a nation trying to diversify the economy and move away from its dependence on copper, Reuters reports.

## A digital future

"What we have to decide is which side are we going to be on: where the new works of the future are created, or where the old works of the past are destroyed," Pinera said.

Edgardo Frias, Google's general manager in Chile, added: "This new stage reinforces the promise Google made to the region to ensure that large and small companies, non-profit organizations, students, educators and all users can access key tools in a reliable and rapid way."

Content: Google has halted plans for a data center in Chile in order to change its designs.

The Associated Press reports that Google will pause the $200 million data center in Chile to address environmental concerns around the site.

The company first obtained permits in 2020 to construct the vast project in the Cerrillos area of Chile’s capital, Santiago.

However, earlier this year a Chilean environmental court partially reversed Google's permit, telling the hyperscaler to revise its application to take into account the effects of climate change, amid local pushback and water concerns over its use of the capital's strained aquifer.

Google announced Tuesday that it would revise the project to comply with more stringent environmental requirements and change its water-intensive cooling system.

Content: Huawei Cloud has opened a Chile region, providing cloud and AI services and acting as a gateway to Latin America for the Chinese company.

The company announced the move at a Summit in Chile last month, where it also spoke of plans to build the first submarine data cable between Asia and Latin America.

## Latam entry

“The Chile region is our first region in Latin America and more regions will be launched this year," said Edward Deng, president of Huawei Cloud Global Market. "We will empower governments and enterprises across Latin America.” The company promised the region would deliver a domestic latency of 20ms, and a latency of 50ms for other Latin American countries.

Rumors of a prospective Huawei data center surfaced in Chilean daily newspaper La Tercera back in February, which would make this a very quick data center delivery, unless the service is being delivered from existing wholesale or retail colocation space. The launch at the Chile Summit was short on details of capacity and location.

Content: ## AWS's $4 Billion Chile Investment Reshapes Latin America's Digital Landscape

SANTIAGO, Chile — Against the backdrop of the towering Andes mountains, a different kind of infrastructure is taking shape. Amazon Web Services' announcement of more than $4 billion in investment to establish a full-scale cloud region in Chile by 2026 marks a watershed moment for Latin America's digital economy, promising to redraw the competitive landscape and accelerate the region's technological transformation.

The investment, which will create three availability zones forming AWS's South America Region, represents far more than routine expansion. It's a calculated strategic maneuver that positions Chile as a pivotal digital hub in the Southern Hemisphere while addressing growing demands for data sovereignty and sustainable computing.

Title: AWS to Invest $4 Billion in Chile for New Cloud Region - Nearshore Americas
URL: https://nearshoreamericas.com/aws-to-invest-4-billion-in-chile-for-new-cloud-region/
Content: Amazon Web Services (AWS) has announced a $4 billion investment to establish a new cloud infrastructure region in Chile.

The new AWS region, expected to be operational by the end of 2026, will be located in Santiago and feature three availability zones.

Designed to support advanced cloud computing services — including artificial intelligence and machine learning—the infrastructure will also power generative AI projects.

This marks AWS’s third region in Latin America, following Brazil and Mexico. The U.S. cloud giant is already serving a string of regional firms, including retailer Cencosud, e-commerce giant MercadoLibre, LATAM Airlines, and dozens of mining firms.

However, the rapid expansion of data centers has sparked growing environmental concerns in Chile, which has endured over 15 years of drought.

In a notable case, Google was forced to revise its $200 million data center plans in the country after facing legal pushback over environmental permits.

To address such issues, AWS will use air and evapo...
