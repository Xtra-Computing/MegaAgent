Content: Scala Data Centers has successfully closed its first international project financing, securing $254 million in long-term financing for the construction of three hyperscale data centers and a critical power substation in Chile.

Adding an additional line for VAT financing brings the total amount of the financing package to $328 million. It is also the largest project finance transaction to date for a single data center project in Latin America.

The deal was made possible by a consortium of four global banks - MUFG, SMBC, BNP Paribas, and Natixis - with MUFG also acting as financial advisor to Scala. This is the company's first structured transaction outside Brazil, as well as its first international green-certified debt issuance.

Today, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced plans to launch a new AWS Region in Chile by the end of 2026. The AWS South America (Chile) Region will consist of three Availability Zones at launch, bringing AWS infrastructure and services closer to customers in Chile. This new Region joins the AWS South America (São Paulo) and AWS Mexico (Central) Regions as our third AWS Region in Latin America. Each Availability Zone is separated by a meaningful distance to support applications that need low latency while significantly reducing the risk of a single event impacting availability.

Content: Brazilian data center operator Ascenty is building a 6.3MW data center in Santiago Chile, the company’s first in the country.

The facility is expected to open in 2020 and is being built in collaboration with an unnamed “leading global” cloud provider.... ## Coming to Chile

Ascenty was established in 2010 with a focus on large scale, high density colocation. In eight years, it has emerged as Latin America’s largest data center provider, with eight facilities currently in operation - across São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceará in Brazil - and another nine under construction. The company also runs its own fiber optic network, spanning more than 4,500 km.

Last September, Ascenty was acquired by carrier-neutral data center operator Digital Realty for $1.8 billion. As part of the agreement, which completed in December, Digital Realty also put up $425 million to fund the completion of data center projects currently under construction.

The Santiago 2 facility is located in the Quilicura district of the capital, covering an area of 21,000 sqm (226,000 sq ft), with 31MW of IT load and capacity for up to 3,550 racks.

The company completed construction work on the facility in July, with an investment of R$500 million in the site so so far; which is due to increase to R$ 770 million after further planned expansions to the structure.

Initially planned for 2021, the construction of Santiago 2 faced delays related to the pandemic along with supply chain issues, COO Marcos Siqueira recently told BNamericas. The facility went live with 20 percent of its capacity already leased, and the company expects that figure to increase to 40 percent by the end of the year.... “Chile is a key and strategic country for Ascenty in Latin America,” said Chris Torto, Ascenty’s CEO and founder. “This new data center enables us to meet regional demands and continue our rapid expansion into other Latin Ame...

Title: Google pauses Chilean data center project to rethink water use
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/google-pauses-chilean-data-center-project-to-rethink-water-use/
Content: Google has halted plans for a data center in Chile in order to change its designs.

The Associated Press reports that Google will pause the $200 million data center in Chile to address environmental concerns around the site.

The company first obtained permits in 2020 to construct the vast project in the Cerrillos area of Chile’s capital, Santiago.

However, earlier this year a Chilean environmental court partially reversed Google's permit, telling the hyperscaler to revise its application to take into account the effects of climate change, amid local pushback and water concerns over its use of the capital's strained aquifer.

Google announced Tuesday that it would revise the project to comply with more stringent environmental requirements and change its water-intensive cooling system.

“A new process will start from scratch,” Google said in a statement. “Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do, and the way we design and manage our data centers is no exception.”

Content: # A new data center in Latin America

Every time someone runs a query on Search, watches a video on YouTube, looks up directions on Google Maps, or uses Gmail for work or school, there's a data center behind the scenes making it all possible. We live in an era in which digital communication and access to information are foundational to the growth and development of countries and the people who live in them. That’s why we opened a data center in Chile in 2015 — to improve the connectivity of our users and the performance of our services. Today, after dedicated planning and analysis, we are taking another step forward with the construction of a second data center in Latin America, this time in Canelones, Uruguay.

We’re investing more than $850 million USD in the new data center, which will bring greater connectivity across the region, help boost the development of governments, businesses and communities — while improving access to the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI).

Title: Google announces $140m Chilean data center expansion

Content: Google plans to expand its only Latin American data center with a $140m investment that will triple the size of the campus in Chile to 11.2 hectares (27.7 acres).

A launch event for the expansion was attended by Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, underscoring the importance of the project for a nation trying to diversify the economy and move away from its dependence on copper, Reuters reports.

## A digital future

"What we have to decide is which side are we going to be on: where the new works of the future are created, or where the old works of the past are destroyed," Pinera said.

Edgardo Frias, Google's general manager in Chile, added: "This new stage reinforces the promise Google made to the region to ensure that large and small companies, non-profit organizations, students, educators and all users can access key tools in a reliable and rapid way."

The construction work is expected to create 1,000 temporary jobs, while the data center will offer 120 permanent positions. Next year will also herald the...

Content: This will add to the assets it already has in the country and seeks to respond to growing demand for its services in Latin America.

Google is preparing to take a new step in its growth plans in Chile. The technology firm plans to build a new data center, for investment of US$200 million, on land located between the municipal districts of San Bernardo and Cerrillos, in the Metropolitan Region.

The company has begun the permitting process in the Environmental Assessment Service and, if permits are obtained, the data center - which serves as physical support for Google's virtual data storage cloud - will add to the complex that is already operating in Quilicura.

It will have two buildings, a structure to house the emergency generators and administrative offices. It will also have parking lots, warehouses and an electrical substation.... ### Better infrastructure
