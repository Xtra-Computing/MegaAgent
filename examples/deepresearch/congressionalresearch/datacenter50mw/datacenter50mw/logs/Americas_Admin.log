Content: ## Inventory (MW)

### North America

North American inventory across the four largest data center markets—Northern Virginia, Chicago, Atlanta and Phoenix—increased 43% year-over-year in Q1. Atlanta and Phoenix were new entrants to the biggest inventory category, surpassing Dallas-Ft. Worth and Silicon Valley in the rankings. Northern Virginia remained the largest global market, adding 523.0 megawatts (MW) over the past year, while Atlanta more than tripled its capacity to 1,279.4 MW, driven by hyperscale, AI start-up and enterprise demand. Phoenix and Chicago also expanded their footprints with steady pipeline activity.

### Europe

Inventory across the four largest European data center markets—London, Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam—increased by 7.2% over the past year, down from the 20% increase between Q1 2023 and Q1 2024 due to challenges securing power. The relative slowdown in new supply was especially pronounced in Amsterdam, where none was added. Frankfurt and Paris had the biggest annual inventory gr...

Content: The scale of AI data centers and their commensurate power needs are growing exponentially. By 2035, Deloitte estimates that power demand from AI data centers in the United States could grow more than thirtyfold, reaching 123 gigawatts, up from 4 gigawatts in 2024 (figure 1).

1 AI data centers can require dramatically more energy per square foot than traditional data centers. For example, a five-acre data center augmenting central processing units with specialized graphics processing units might see its energy usage increase from 5 to 50 megawatts. 2

The leading AI infrastructure developers that are scaling data center networks globally are known as hyperscalers. Each of the top three hyperscalers’ largest US data centers currently draw less than 500 megawatts (MW) of power but the largest data centers they are constructing or planning to build are more than double to quadruple the capacities of completed projects.

Content: ## The potential federal data center sites are “uniquely positioned for rapid data center construction, including in-place energy infrastructure,” according to the Department of Energy

The U.S. Department of Energy has identified 16 federally owned sites that could potentially host data centers and AI infrastructure and already have associated power resources available.

DoE has also put out an accompanying request for information on proposals for construction of those data centers, with the aim of supporting operational AI infrastructure by the end of 2027.

The move by the Trump administration expands, changes and seeks to move faster than one of the actions taken in the final days of the Biden administration, when the Departments of Defense and Energy were tasked with identifying and leasing at three least federal sites for “frontier AI data centers” that could be powered by clean energy such as geothermal, plus another list of 10 high-priority sites that could be made available to serve AI data centers w...

Content: The surge of artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics, and cloud computing has created a rise in demand for massive data centers.

Even though many of the platforms and services that we rely on for daily commerce, communication, and information storage work and exist “in the cloud,” they still require a significant physical footprint to house and secure the entire world’s personal, transactional, and miscellaneous information.

The global data center market is expected to reach approximately USD 624.07 billion by 2029. Additionally, McKinsey estimates that global demand for data center capacity could more than triple by 2030.

Each of the top three hyperscalers’ largest US data centers currently draw less than 500 megawatts (MW) of power but the largest data centers they are constructing or planning to build are more than double to quadruple the capacities of completed projects. The largest of these are expected to require up to 2,000 MW—that is, 2 gigawatts (GW) (figure ...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 5:\nTitle: 15 MASSIVE Data Centers Under Construction\nURL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isr-WK1GEJc\nContent: {ts:0} around the world these new high performance data centers are under construction they're going to be designed to deliver unprecedented speed and processing power for artificial intelligence applications so in today's video we're going to take a look at 15\n{ts:13} of the largest data centers currently being built let's start with number 15 The Meta AI data center in Louisiana in a major step for both technology and Regional development meta Facebook's parent company is building its largest AI data center yet in\n{ts:31} northeastern Louisiana it's located on a 2200 ACR site between Rayville and Delhi and this 10 billion project marks a huge leap forward in AI infrastructure while also delivering a much-needed economic boost to that region at 4 million square ft this facility will be one of the largest hyperscale AI data centers in\n{ts:50} the world now these hyperscale centers are designed to handle massive amounts of data powering Advanced Tech like AI training deep learning and real-time data analysis t...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 6:\nTitle: Where are the 16 data center, AI infra federal sites?\nURL: https://www.rcrwireless.com/20250408/ai-infrastructure/16-federal-data-center\nContent: ## The potential federal data center sites are “uniquely positioned for rapid data center construction, including in-place energy infrastructure,” according to the Department of Energy\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy has identified 16 federally owned sites that could potentially host data centers and AI infrastructure and already have associated power resources available.\n\nDoE has also put out an accompanying request for information on proposals for construction of those data centers, with the aim of supporting operational AI infrastructure by the end of 2027.\n\nThe move by the Trump administration expands, changes and seeks to move faster than one of the actions taken in the final days of the Biden administration, when the Departments of Defense and Energy were tasked with identifying and leasing at three least federal sites for “frontier AI data centers” that could be powered by clean energy such as geothermal, plus another list of 10 high-priority sites that could be made available to serve AI data centers w...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 7:\nTitle: See where data centers are across the US on our interactive map\nURL: https://www.businessinsider.com/data-center-locations-us-map-ai-boom-2025-9\nContent: In June, Business Insider published an investigation into the data center industry.

We have witnessed significant challenges and transformation in Latin America in the past year. Businesses across the region have grappled with political tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, high interest rates and shifting regulatory landscapes—as well as the boom in AI.

The elections in Latin America in 2024 are now behind us, though, as expected, the results have led to as many questions about the future as they have to answers. We are particularly focused on Venezuela and are hopeful that the democratic aspirations of the people of Venezuela will be respected. The US presidential election has also now concluded, and its outcome could have significant consequences for many jurisdictions.

In this year's edition of Latin America Focus, we will explore some of these complex dynamics and consider how companies can adapt to changes and capitalize on trends to forge a path through this ever-changing environment.

Content: ## Inventory (MW)

### North America

North American inventory across the four largest data center markets—Northern Virginia, Chicago, Atlanta and Phoenix—increased 43% year-over-year in Q1. Atlanta and Phoenix were new entrants to the biggest inventory category, surpassing Dallas-Ft. Worth and Silicon Valley in the rankings. Northern Virginia remained the largest global market, adding 523.0 megawatts (MW) over the past year, while Atlanta more than tripled its capacity to 1,279.4 MW, driven by hyperscale, AI start-up and enterprise demand. Phoenix and Chicago also expanded their footprints with steady pipeline activity.

### Europe

Inventory across the four largest European data center markets—London, Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam—increased by 7.2% over the past year, down from the 20% increase between Q1 2023 and Q1 2024 due to challenges securing power. The relative slowdown in new supply was especially pronounced in Amsterdam, where none was added. Frankfurt and Paris had the biggest annual inventory gr...

URL: https://www.avilatinoamerica.com/en/news/latest-news/293-enterprises/25915-data-centers-for-future-ai-demands.html
Content: *Latin America*. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is no longer just a technology of the future; It has become a transformative application. Unlike traditional AI, which involves performing specific tasks using defined algorithms and rules, GenAI creates new content from large volumes of data.

But it's much more than content generation: it drives innovation by enabling real-time decisions, simplifying complex processes, and accelerating progress. This rapid growth also creates unprecedented computational demand and higher rack densities, requiring new generations of advanced cooling, resilient power, and scalable architectures to sustain AI workloads.

The way forward demands concrete answers: How can data centers adapt to withstand the increased data processing, temperatures, and power consumption that AI requires?

While these challenges are global, Latin America is experiencing them in a particular way. Digital transformation was already underway in the region, but the pandemic accelerated its ad...

**Latin America’s Data Center Boom Gains Momentum**

In 2025, Latin America has emerged as one of the most dynamic and fiercely competitive data center markets on the planet. Historically overlooked in favor of North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, the region is now at the center of a digital infrastructure renaissance. A combination of explosive cloud growth, AI-driven compute needs, fintech innovation, and sweeping regulatory changes has accelerated the region’s emergence as a critical hub for global hyperscalers.

Multinational cloud providers, regional telecom giants, and global private equity funds are collectively pouring billions into the region. New hyperscale campuses are breaking ground across Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina, as demand for colocation, cloud regions, and edge deployments soars. Improved subsea connectivity, favorable government incentives, and a growing digital-first consumer base are creating one of the world’s fastest-growing data center markets. Latin America...

Content: ## Competitive Landscape

The South America Artificial Intelligence industry remains fragmented, yet consolidation signals began appearing in 2024 as leading cloud service providers acquired niche model-ops startups. Local champions differentiate by embedding domain expertise in algorithms rather than competing purely on generic tooling. Vendors that focus on compliance modules, especially for the financial sector, win longer-term annuity contracts because banks face non-negotiable audit requirements. Consequently, product roadmaps increasingly prioritize automated model documentation and bias detection features.

Strategic alliances between multinational cloud providers and telcos accelerate reach into underserved mid-market accounts. Telcos contribute distribution muscle through existing connectivity contracts, while cloud partners supply technology stacks. The combination reduces customer acquisition costs and standardizes support, indirectly promoting subscription renewals. Over the medium term, joint go-...

Local champions differentiate by embedding domain expertise in algorithms rather than competing purely on generic tooling. Vendors that focus on compliance modules, especially for the financial sector, win longer-term annuity contracts because banks face non-negotiable audit requirements. Consequently, product roadmaps increasingly prioritize automated model documentation and bias detection features.\n\nStrategic alliances between multinational cloud providers and telcos accelerate reach into underserved mid-market accounts.

We have witnessed significant challenges and transformation in Latin America in the past year. Businesses across the region have grappled with political tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, high interest rates and shifting regulatory landscapes—as well as the boom in AI.

The elections in Latin America in 2024 are now behind us, though, as expected, the results have led to as many questions about the future as they have to answers. We are particularly focused on Venezuela and are hopeful that the democratic aspirations of the people of Venezuela will be respected. The US presidential election has also now concluded, and its outcome could have significant consequences for many jurisdictions.

In this year's edition of Latin America Focus, we will explore some of these complex dynamics and consider how companies can adapt to changes and capitalize on trends to forge a path through this ever-changing environment.

### Rapid Build-out of High-Density, Liquid-Ready Capacity

Hyperscale cloud providers and regional colocation operators are racing to retrofit or green-field sites with power densities of 30–50 kW per rack and liquid-cooling manifolds to accommodate graphics processors used for large-scale AI training. Equinix, Ascenty, and Scala Data Centers all commissioned new halls in São Paulo and Santiago this year that feature rear-door heat exchangers and immersion tanks sized specifically for Nvidia H100-class clusters. The acceleration shortens provisioning lead times for enterprises that previously had to export demanding workloads to North America, tightening regional latency loops for AI inference and analytics.

For instance, in August 2024, Scala Data Centers broke ground on a 300 MW hyperscale campus in Porto Alegre that will feature closed-loop immersion tanks capable of supporting rack densities above 50 kW. The company’s ...

Content: ## Introduction

We have witnessed significant challenges and transformation in Latin America in the past year. Businesses across the region have grappled with political tensions, macroeconomic uncertainty, high interest rates and shifting regulatory landscapes—as well as the boom in AI.

The elections in Latin America in 2024 are now behind us, though, as expected, the results have led to as many questions about the future as they have to answers. We are particularly focused on Venezuela and are hopeful that the democratic aspirations of the people of Venezuela will be respected. The US presidential election has also now concluded, and its outcome could have significant consequences for many jurisdictions.

In this year's edition of Latin America Focus, we will explore some of these complex dynamics and consider how companies can adapt to changes and capitalize on trends to forge a path through this ever-changing environment.

We begin with a look at our extensive pro bono efforts in the region, which focus ...
