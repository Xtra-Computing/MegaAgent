Content: **From steam engines to AI clusters: a historical perspective**

Every technological revolution is supported by a specific infrastructure. Steam locomotives required extensive railway networks, electrification brought high-voltage grids, and the internet demanded fiber optic connections and data centers. Today, we are on the threshold of a new phase: large-scale artificial intelligence. AI is not a marginal technological innovation, but a fundamental productivity driver that is redefining industrial structures, value chains, and geopolitical power relations.

Historically, countries that invested early in the dominant infrastructure of their time achieved long-term economic and geopolitical advantages. In the 19th century, Great Britain built a railway network at record speed, the United States invested in a national highway system after World War II, and South Korea laid a digital backbone in the 1990s that now makes the country a world leader in semiconductors.

Content: # Dutch government presents vision on generative AI

As one of the first EU Member States, the Dutch government will today present a vision on generative AI. In this vision, the government emphasises the urgent need to take action with a view to the opportunities and challenges of this disruptive and at the same time promising technology. The vision ties in with a series of investments with of millions of euros already made by research institutions, private enterprises and government, all aimed at bringing the Netherlands more into line with the lightning-paced developments in the field of artificial intelligence.

In the words of Minister for Digitalisation Alexandra van Huffelen, “We wish to retain the values and prosperity of the Netherlands. According to figures from the IMF, in developed economies, up to sixty percent of jobs could be affected by AI.

Content: With pride, we present the anniversary edition of our annual State of the Dutch Data Centers report, this year themed: “From Boom to Bottlenecks.” This special edition marks ten years of independent data center analysis and highlights the sector’s evolution into an essential pillar of the Dutch digital economy.

The annual DDA market report is compiled based on research among members of the Dutch Data Center Association, in collaboration with Pb7 Research. The report offers a unique overview of the current state of the sector and delves into trends, investments, sustainability, regional growth, and the impact of emerging technologies such as AI.

**From Boom to Bottlenecks**

The theme “From Boom to Bottlenecks” not only reflects the successes of the past decade, but also underscores the need for shared responsibility for the future. Data centers are no longer a niche phenomenon, they are fundamental to innovation, economic resilience, and digital sovereignty.

Content: Europe's digital ambitions collide with energy infrastructure limitations as the Netherlands experiences unprecedented grid congestion that serves as a harbinger for the continent's AI future. The crisis emerged prominently today, when the Financial Times published comprehensive reporting revealing that more than 11,900 businesses await electricity network connections across the Netherlands, forcing network operators to ration power supply.

The situation demonstrates Europe's unpreparedness for AI energy demands, with data centers requiring electricity consumption equivalent to 100,000 households each. According to the International Energy Agency, Europe accounts for approximately 15% of global data center electricity consumption at 70 TWh in 2024, yet this figure is projected to grow by more than 45 TWh by 2030 - a 70% increase that coincides with accelerated AI adoption across industries.

Content: The Netherlands has positioned itself as Europe’s data hub, and the numbers show this foundation is ready for significant expansion.

The market is projected to reach $6.42 billion in 2025 and is expected to grow at a 7.04% annual rate through 2030, reaching $9.02 billion. But what’s driving this growth, and where will it come from?

### Room to grow

The numbers tell an interesting story about where growth can happen. Dutch data centres occupy 239 hectares—that’s just 0.3% of industrial land. More importantly, they’ve kept electricity use flat for a decade while handling exponentially more data. This isn’t an accident, the Netherlands has built an industry that grows through efficiency rather than just adding more facilities.

That approach matters now because the next phase of growth looks different. Edge computing needs smaller, distributed sites rather than massive hyperscale facilities.

The Dutch model of efficient, sustainable operations can handle this shift. And perhaps most importantly, operators ca...

Content: The Dutch government has announced it will impose stricter rules for hyperscale data centers - and has banned new projects for nine months, while the new rules are worked out.

The ban will not affect Facebook's effort to build in Zeewolde, though this currently faces difficulties due to a government land sale. Other previously approved plans will go ahead, and projects such as Google's Groningen project, and others in Middenmeer will be allowed to go ahead because these areas are exempt from the ban.

"Our space is limited, so we have to make the right choices," said housing and planning minister Hugo De Jonge in a letter to the House of Representatives, according to a report on the Netherlands government website. "Hyperscale data centers take up a lot of space and consume a disproportionate amount of available renewable energy. That is why the cabinet wants to prevent hyperscale data centers being built throughout the Netherlands."

Content: Europe's digital ambitions collide with energy infrastructure limitations as the Netherlands experiences unprecedented grid congestion that serves as a harbinger for the continent's AI future. The crisis emerged prominently today, when the Financial Times published comprehensive reporting revealing that more than 11,900 businesses await electricity network connections across the Netherlands, forcing network operators to ration power supply.

The situation demonstrates Europe's unpreparedness for AI energy demands, with data centers requiring electricity consumption equivalent to 100,000 households each. According to the International Energy Agency, Europe accounts for approximately 15% of global data center electricity consumption at 70 TWh in 2024, yet this figure is projected to grow by more than 45 TWh by 2030 - a 70% increase that coincides with accelerated AI adoption across industries.

Content: Today, the Dutch Data Center Association (DDA) presents the anniversary edition of the State of the Dutch Data Centers report during National Data Center Day. The report offers a unique overview of ten years of data center development in the Netherlands and shows how the sector has evolved into a cornerstone of our digital economy.

**Market Outlook 2025: AI and Scale-up Drive Market Dynamics**

The Dutch data center market continues to grow despite ongoing challenges related to grid congestion and permitting procedures. In 2024, the total colocation capacity reached 924 megawatts. For 2025, the sector expects a record investment of more than €1.4 billion. Increasingly, data center operators are building scalable colocation campuses to meet the rapidly growing demand for computing power driven by AI and cloud applications. At the same time, enterprise data centers are losing ground, as organizations increasingly opt for colocation or cloud infrastructure.

By Data Center Size: Hyperscale Scaling Outpaces Legacy Footprints

Large facilities retained 41.88% Netherlands data center market share in 2024, reflecting entrenched enterprise and multi-tenant demand clustered around Amsterdam’s carrier hotels. However, mega campuses are projected to post a 6.70% CAGR to 2030 as hyperscalers condense compute into fewer, energy-efficient locations. The Netherlands data center market size for mega facilities is set to exceed 800 MW by 2030, driven by Oracle’s USD 1 billion AI deployment and Google’s phased Westpoort build. Mega sites justify capital-intensive liquid cooling and onsite substation investments that smaller footprints cannot amortize. At the other end, small and micro data centers address edge latency targets but face cost headwinds tied to staffing and remote management.
