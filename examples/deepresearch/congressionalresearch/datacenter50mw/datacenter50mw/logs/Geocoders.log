Content: Oracle is not a new name in the field of IT. It is best known for its database. However, with purchase of Netsuite (first cloud company) for $9.3 billion in July 2016, Oracle has made major entry into cloud industry as well. Oracle cloud was initially known as “Oracle Bare Metal Cloud Services”. With Oracle managed data centers in around 19 geographical locations, it provides:

- Infrastructure as a Service

- Platform as a Service

- Software as a Service

- Data as a Service

Oracle Cloud supports varieties of programming languages, databases, applications, tools and frameworks. It can support processing of big-data as well.... ## Oracle Cloud Data Center Locations

Oracle has built or operated cloud data centers in various locations and regions of the world. Like every other major cloud providers, it has classified its cloud infrastructures and locations into regions and availability zones. In case of Oracle, availability zones are known as “Domains”. One region can have one or more availability domains. S...

Title: Oracle Cloud Data Center Centers Locations Regions
URL: https://dgtlinfra.com/oracle-cloud-data-center-locations/
Content: **How Many Data Centers Does Oracle Cloud Have?**

Oracle Cloud currently has 48 regions in operation and a further 5 under development, meaning that the company will have a

**total** of 53 regions available in the near-term.

Each Oracle Cloud

**region** is composed of 1 to 3 isolated and physically separate data centers with distinct physical infrastructure (i.e., power, cooling, and networking), known by Oracle as **availability domains**, and commonly referred to by other cloud service providers as availability zones. Within the same region, these availability domains are interconnected by a low-latency, high-bandwidth network.

Over the coming years, Oracle plans to build 100 new cloud data centers to meet “billions of dollars” in excess contracted demand that exceeds its current capacity, which is constrained by data center space, power requirements, and GPU availability.

Ultimately, Oracle plans to establish a minimum of two geographically distributed cloud regions in every country where it operates...

Content: Equinix is partnering with an array of energy suppliers—many of them nuclear—in a long-term strategy to keep pace with the growing data center power shortage. The colocation giant unveiled a slate of agreements spanning small modular reactors, transportable microreactors, and an expansion of on-site fuel cells. The energy mix underscores a pragmatic strategy: lock in a wide array of low-carbon electricity as artificial intelligence drives unprecedented demand.

At the center of the plan is a 500-megawatt procurement agreement with nuclear developer Oklo, whose fast-fission Aurora units are designed to run on recycled nuclear material. Equinix also pre-ordered 20 Kaleidos microreactors from Radiant. These portable, factory-built units are engineered for rapid installation and integration with a site’s existing electrical infrastructure.

In Europe, the company signed a letter of intent with Amsterdam-based ULC-Energy for up to 250 MWe tied to Rolls-Royce’s 470-MWe SMR program. And it agreed to a pre-order for ...

Content: The coming generation of advanced nuclear reactor companies is counting on data center operators as key customers for their tech—and the feeling is mutual.

Equinix, a data center operator with 270 active sites globally, announced a new agreement with Radiant to purchase 20 of the company’s Kaleidos deployable microreactors. The agreement is the largest deal for any mass-manufactured reactor to date, according to Radiant—and it comes with a deposit down on the order.

And that’s not all. Equinix also announced other collaborations with the nuclear energy sector:

- The company signed an LoI with ULC-Energy, a Dutch nuclear developer that is looking to build Rolls-Royce SMRs in the Netherlands. The LoI covers a power purchase agreement for up to 250 MW of electricity.

- Equinix also secured a pre-order agreement with Stellaria, a molten salt reactor company, for 500 MW of electricity across Europe to power data centers.

Content: Perceptions of the palpable convergence of the nuclear energy and data center industries were already running high this quarter after news of Amazon's purchase last month of a 900 megawatt (MW)+ nuclear energy data center campus in Pennsylvania.

Now a month later comes word that Equinix wants to purchase hundreds of megawatts of power from Oklo, the California-based nuclear fission startup backed by OpenAI founder and CEO Sam Altman, which aims to manufacture small modular reactor (SMR) technology for data center and industrial energy generation.

Oklo's stated mission is "to provide clean, reliable, affordable energy on a global scale through the design and deployment of next-generation fast reactor technology." The company adds that it is pursuing an owner-operator model with an intention to sell power directly to customers under long-term contracts, providing a source of recurring revenue.

Oklo expects its SMRs to generate up to 15 MW of power, while operating for more than a decade without refueling. Wh...
