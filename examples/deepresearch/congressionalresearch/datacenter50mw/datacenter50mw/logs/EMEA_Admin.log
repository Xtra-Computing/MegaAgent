Title: Global Data Center Trends 2025 | CBRE
URL: https://www.cbre.com/insights/reports/global-data-center-trends-2025
Content: ### Paris

Paris overtook Amsterdam last year as Europeâ€™s third-largest data center market. It has seen demand from sovereign cloud deployments and the emerging sovereign AI segment, as well as French quantum computing companies. The metropolitan area accounts for more than 80% of French data center supply and a similar percentage of French unicorn companies (start-ups of US$1 billion valuation). Many of these companies have moved from cloud to colocation providers.

#### Opportunities:

- Demand from new AI and quantum computing companies has supported the Paris colocation market. As these companies add scale, several are migrating from their cloud provider to use dedicated data center capacity with a lower cost of ownership. French public sector and enterprises are starting to migrate to sovereign cloud and AI services as outsourcing becomes more common.

#### Challenges:

- Operators still face excessive red tape for permitting and regulatory permission across several government tiers for new data center d...

Title: Chart: Which Regions Have the Biggest Data Centers? - Statista
URL: https://www.statista.com/chart/31372/regions-cities-with-highest-data-center-power-capacity/
Content: The AI boom is fuelling the need for increased computing demand from the worldâ€™s data center network. According to a new report by the International Energy Agency, this demand will more than double by 2030.

The highest concentration of data center capacity can be found in Northern Virginia, accounting for nearly 7 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity in 2024. According to an interview with the vice chairman of real estate service provider CBRE, Rob Faktorow, with radio broadcaster WTOP in 2022, the main reasons are tax incentives, superior connectivity and infrastructure well suited to the resource needs of big server farms. Northern Virginiaâ€™s infrastructure is set to expand even further in the coming years, with around 5 percent of the worldâ€™s capacity currently under construction based there. Other key data center sites in the U.S. include Chicago, Dallas and Omaha in Nebraska. Combined, these four locations summed to around 12.4 GW of installed capacity in 2024 and just over 10 percent of the global capa...

URL: https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2025/06/Grids-for-data-centres-in-Europe.pdf
Content: â€‹centres addedâ€‹â€‹more than â‚¬150 billionâ€‹â€‹to their market caps since November 2022,â€‹
â€‹on the back of AIâ€™s soaring demand for data centres. For one company, Siemensâ€‹
â€‹AG, this meant its market value grew byâ€‹â€‹more thanâ€‹â€‹60%â€‹â€‹.â€‹
â€‹Data centres also have a significant role to play in the EUâ€™sâ€‹â€‹wider energy securityâ€‹
â€‹and competitiveness agendaâ€‹â€‹and its drive for digitalâ€‹â€‹sovereignty. Many AIâ€‹
â€‹applications requireâ€‹â€‹high levels of security and dataâ€‹â€‹controlâ€‹, making the locationâ€‹
â€‹of digital infrastructure a strategic concern. The EU has identified digital and dataâ€‹
â€‹sovereignty aâ€‹â€‹central priorityâ€‹â€‹, emphasising the needâ€‹â€‹for infrastructure thatâ€‹
â€‹ensures European data is stored, processed and governed under EU laws.â€‹

Title: Europe Data Center Power Market Size & Share Analysis
URL: https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/europe-data-center-power-market
Content: Grid-capacity bottlenecks in Tier-1 metros

Frankfurt faces power-connection queues that stretch beyond 2030; Londonâ€™s West-Drayton zone is likewise oversubscribed despite National Gridâ€™s multibillion-pound reinforcement plan. Amsterdam imposed a moratorium on hyperscale sites in Noord-Holland until 2026, diverting growth to Eindhoven and Brussels. These limits inflate land and power premiums and drive a patchwork of secondary clusters whose fiber density often lags demand, challenging network engineers.... ## Geography Analysis

Germany anchors the Europe data center power market, aided by a 62.7% renewable mix in 2024 and a regulatory fast track that classifies data centers as critical infrastructure. Frankfurtâ€™s landlord-controlled power reservations exceed 1 GW, yet extended queue times push newer development toward Saarland and Lower Saxony. Operators typically negotiate dual utility feeds plus on-site cogeneration, enabling PUEs below 1.25 even at 30 Â°C ambient temperature. Compliance with the 1.2 PUE c...

URL: https://straitsresearch.com/statistic/countries-with-the-most-data-centers
Content: Manchester serves as a secondary hub for the UK's data center market, which is primarily concentrated on London and the M25 corridor. By 2030, the nation's power capacity is predicted to increase from 2,590 MW in 2025 to 4,750 MW. The UK is witnessing an increase in colocation and hyperscale facilities, similar to other regions. With a combined capacity of 953 MW, Paris and Marseille dominate the French market. Here, colocation and cloud centers are prevalent, and sustainability is becoming more and more important.

The data center market in Australia is growing rapidly. The growth of cloud services and artificial intelligence has made Sydney and Melbourne important hubs. The Netherlands, especially Amsterdam, also hosts a strong market with an expected power capacity of 1,480 MW by 2030. The majority of Dutch data centers are Tier III, which is renowned for its high reliability.

Content: # Top 10 largest data centres in Europe

Last quarter saw record demand for data centres across Europe, with the EMEA Data Centres Q2 2023 report showing the take up across last quarter was more than double the 51 MW seen in Q1, according to the new research carried out by JLL. The property consultancy company specialists also predict that core European data centre markets are set for record growth in 2023, with 17% increase in new supply and 32% more take-up expected.

The top providers in Europe are Equinix with 83 sites and Lumen Technologies with 56 facilities. Here, we round up some of the largest data centre providers and facilities across the European continent.

It has seen demand from sovereign cloud deployments and the emerging sovereign AI segment, as well as French quantum computing companies. The metropolitan area accounts for more than 80% of French data center supply and a similar percentage of French unicorn companies (start-ups of US$1 billion valuation). Many of these companies have moved from cloud to colocation providers.\n\n#### Opportunities:\n\n- Demand from new AI and quantum computing companies has supported the Paris colocation market. As these companies add scale, several are migrating from their cloud provider to use dedicated data center capacity with a lower cost of ownership. French public sector and enterprises are starting to migrate to sovereign cloud and AI services as outsourcing becomes more common.\n\n#### Challenges:\n\n- Operators still face excessive red tape for permitting and regulatory permission across several government tiers for new data center d...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 3:\nTitle: Chart: Which Regions Have the Biggest Data Centers? - Statista\nURL: https://www.statista.com/chart/31372/regions-cities-with-highest-data-center-power-capacity/\nContent: The AI boom is fuelling the need for increased computing demand from the worldâ€™s data center network. According to a new report by the International Energy Agency, this demand will more than double by 2030.\n\nThe highest concentration of data center capacity can be found in Northern Virginia, accounting for nearly 7 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity in 2024. According to an interview with the vice chairman of real estate service provider CBRE, Rob Faktorow, with radio broadcaster WTOP in 2022, the main reasons are tax incentives, superior connectivity and infrastructure well suited to the resource needs of big server farms. Northern Virginiaâ€™s infrastructure is set to expand even further in the coming years, with around 5 percent of the worldâ€™s capacity currently under construction based there. Other key data center sites in the U.S. include Chicago, Dallas and Omaha in Nebraska.
