patterns and land availability in the various cities included in the research. Denser, more built out areas have smaller

instance of a community that imposes a maximum size limit on data center facilities. Atlanta limits data centers to a
maximum size of 150,000 square feet of floor area per floor if a proposed data center is not part of a “unified plan.” A
center that is part of such a plan may be up to 300,000 square feet per floor in floor area.
Minimum building setbacks are common in most zoning districts where data centers are permitted, and are also
generally unrelated to the specific permitted use of the property. Once again, the range of variation is very large –

Content: ## Trump Administration Gives Data Centers a Big Push

*New York Law Journal*

By E. Gail Suchman and Mark Sundback

As information systems have expanded, the electricity needs of data centers have grown exponentially, largely from crypto-mining and artificial intelligence (AI). Data centers operate at high load factors and require dedicated reliable electricity for significant computation and cooling demands.

For the last few years, many data centers constructed in the U.S. have emphasized their use of renewable energy. With the Administration’s change of policy regarding wind and solar generation, and its desire to return to fossil-fuel derived electricity, it has prioritized powering data centers with traditional power resources.

On July 23, 2025, the Trump Administration issued an Executive Order for

*Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure* (E.O. 14148) (“EO”). The EO defines a “Data Center Project” as “a facility that requires greater than 100 MW of new load dedicated to AI infe...

Content: # America's AI Action Plan: A Radical Shift in U.S. Data Center Development Strategy

The Executive Order, titled “ ACCELERATING FEDERAL PERMITTING OF DATA CENTER INFRASTRUCTURE” as signed by President Trump on July 23, 2025, aims to streamline federal permitting for AI-centric data centers—facilities requiring over 100 MW of power. It directly implements the mandates of Pillar II of the America’s AI Action Plan, also announced this July, which frames AI infrastructure as a cornerstone of U.S. economic and national security policy.

Together, these two documents reflect what has the potential to become a radical shift in U.S. data center development strategy. It provides a path away from market-constrained, sequential, and regulation-heavy projects and toward federally coordinated, defense-aligned, and energy-integrated hyperscale deployment.

There is nothing subtle about the President’s approach to the future of large-scale data center projects. His preamble to the AI Action Plan states:

## Surging Demand Drives Record New Data Center Development

February 26, 2025 10 Minute Read

## State of the Market

- Supply in primary data center markets increased by 34% year-over-year to 6,922.6 megawatts (MW), far surpassing the 26% increase in 2023.

- Primary markets had a record 6,350 MW under construction at the end of 2024, more than double the 3,077.8 MW at year-end 2023. This surge was driven by robust demand and extended construction timelines due to power constraints and supply chain delays.

- The overall vacancy rate in primary markets fell to a record-low 1.9% at year-end. Only a handful of facilities with 10 MW or more are slated for delivery in 2025 and are not yet leased, reflecting the scarcity of large-scale available inventory.

- Atlanta led all primary markets for net absorption in 2024 with 705.8 MW, well above perennial leader Northern Virginia’s 451.7 MW. This was the first time any market surpassed Northern Virginia in annual net abso...

Title: AI data center growth: Meeting the demand

Content: A small group of graphics processing unit (GPU) cloud providers is also emerging to meet the demand for AI-ready data center capacity. As the name suggests, these providers offer high-performance GPUs as a service to train AI models, then often work with colocation providers to build and operate the data center facility. GPU cloud provider CoreWeave, for example, had a fleet of approximately 45,000 GPUs by July 2024 and aims to operate in 28 locations globally by the end of the year.

This new capacity is not likely to keep pace with demand, however. Tight supply is already apparent in the market. Prices charged by colocation providers for available data center capacity in the United States fell steadily from 2014 to 2020 in most primary markets but then rose by an average of 35 percent between 2020 and 2023. Additionally, new capacity due to come online in the next two to three years has already been leased out.

## Vacancy declines to a new record low, constraining sector growth

Colocation vacancy is nearing 0%, which is constraining economic growth and undermining national security. Data centers are critical infrastructure and restrictive market conditions are counterproductive over the long-term.

The construction pipeline of 8 GW is 73% preleased, signaling that any meaningful loosening of market conditions remains a few years away at minimum. Even if preleasing activity slows significantly in the near-term, vacancy would likely remain below 5% through 2027. A more likely scenario is that vacancy holds in the 2% range through 2027.

Companies looking to expand their data center operations may be limited to preleasing in new developments. This could be followed by a year or mo...

Content: ## Americas

Power availability remains the top consideration for data center developers, with operators in the Americas seeking two- to three-year delivery timelines but often facing delays of five years or more. Where utility providers can’t provide power sooner, some operators have partnered with power companies to build substations, transmission lines, or to tap into microgrid power. Growing demand for large-scale power, abundant land and relaxed latency requirements for AI has also driven hyperscalers and operators to expand into historically peripheral markets like Indianapolis, Kansas City and the Carolinas. While these emerging markets have been gaining traction, they still trail established markets in development pipelines.

Content: ## North American Data Center Deals

Analysts’ forecasts of hundreds of billions in data center investment are materializing, with Microsoft planning an $80 billion buildout in 2025.

The company said the funds would be used to create new data centers, mainly in the US but also further afield, underscoring the intense capital requirements of AI systems.

More than half of this projected spending through June 2025 will be in the US, Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a New Year blog post. Recent AI progress is thanks to “large-scale infrastructure investments that serve as the essential foundation of AI innovation and use,” Smith wrote.

While the news was welcomed by many as an indication of things to come in 2025, it was tempered by the announcement that Microsoft had paused construction of portions of its multibillion-dollar data center campus in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin. The tech giant received approval for the campus in November 2023.

Actually, what we’re talking about is Mark’s response on threads to a recent report in SemiAnalysis that broke the news on his gargantuan new data centers.

**That is, Meta's two new gigawatt-scale AI clusters:**

- Prometheus (slated for 2026): Located in New Albany, Ohio, 1 gigawatt (GW) capacity with on-site natural gas generation and ultra-high-bandwidth networking.

- Hyperion (slated for 2030): Nicknamed

*The Beast*, this one will likely be in Richland Parish, Louisiana, a $10B investment scaling from 2GW by 2030 up to 5GW.

These data centers are so massive that just one “covers a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan.”

**The Largest Infrastructure Investment in Microsoft’s History**

In a bold and unprecedented move, Microsoft has announced a sweeping $80 billion investment into building and expanding AI-optimized data centers through 2028. This marks the largest infrastructure commitment in the company’s history—more than double what it spent on Azure between 2018 and 2022 combined.

At the center of this expansion is Microsoft’s aggressive bet on multimodal AI, sovereign cloud, Copilot at scale, and a redefined version of enterprise productivity powered by custom silicon and tightly integrated infrastructure.

What began as a partnership with OpenAI in 2019 has now become a global strategy to own the AI stack end-to-end—from silicon and software to the fiber routes and cooling towers that make intelligence usable and fast.

This blog dives into what Microsoft is building, where the capital is going, and how this investment is set to redefine the cloud wars, the AI economy, and the future of work.

Fortune 500 CEOs face a choice in 2025: Migrate to the cloud now and capture its powerful advantages or watch competitors build their leads while you continue with legacy infrastructure. That might sound dramatic, but several converging forces make now the right moment to move to the cloud if you haven’t already done so. In our team’s conversations with over 1,500 AWS customer executives annually, we find leaders who spent years debating cloud strategy now asking: “How fast can we get there?”

Cloud migrations are picking up speed. Analysts estimate the cloud computing market at $675.4 billion in 2024, growing 2.5% from the previous year.^1^ The cloud migration market is projected to grow from $232.51 billion in 2024 to $806.41 billion by 2029, with a CAGR of 28.24%.^2^ Analysts project small and medium-sized businesses will to allocate more than half of their technology budgets to cloud services in 2025.^1^

Two-and-a-half years ago, we flagged a looming “cloud crisis” at AWS. Today, the evidence has mounted. AWS is the crown jewel of the Amazon empire, generating ~60% of group profits, and dominating the lucrative Cloud Computing market. But it struggles to translate this strength into the new GPU/XPU Cloud era.

Microsoft Azure now leads the market on quarterly new cloud revenue, and the gap between Google Cloud and AWS has materially narrowed especially with Google's big moves on the TPU that we've been posting about for over a month. Markets have noticed. Year-to-date, Amazon is the clear laggard among the four tech-and-AI titans as investors mark down the company most for losing momentum in AI.

Analysts’ forecasts of hundreds of billions in data center investment are materializing, with Microsoft planning an $80 billion buildout in 2025.

The company said the funds would be used to create new data centers, mainly in the US but also further afield, underscoring the intense capital requirements of AI systems.

More than half of this projected spending through June 2025 will be in the US, Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a New Year blog post. Recent AI progress is thanks to “large-scale infrastructure investments that serve as the essential foundation of AI innovation and use,” Smith wrote.

While the news was welcomed by many as an indication of things to come in 2025, it was tempered by the announcement that Microsoft had paused construction of portions of its multibillion-dollar data center campus in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin. The tech giant received approval for the campus in November 2023.

Content: The scale of AI data centers and their commensurate power needs are growing exponentially. By 2035, Deloitte estimates that power demand from AI data centers in the United States could grow more than thirtyfold, reaching 123 gigawatts, up from 4 gigawatts in 2024 (figure 1).

1 AI data centers can require dramatically more energy per square foot than traditional data centers. For example, a five-acre data center augmenting central processing units with specialized graphics processing units might see its energy usage increase from 5 to 50 megawatts. 2

The leading AI infrastructure developers that are scaling data center networks globally are known as hyperscalers. Each of the top three hyperscalers’ largest US data centers currently draw less than 500 megawatts (MW) of power but the largest data centers they are constructing or planning to build are more than double to quadruple the capacities of completed projects. The largest of these are expected to require up to 2,000 MW—that is, 2 gigawatts (GW) (figure ...

These joint ventures with investors are becoming an important tool for data center companies to fund growth, and provide a vehicle for investors to gain a foothold in the data center industry as it emerges as an important new asset class.\n\nThe deal reinforces the growing importance of infrastructure investors in providing capital to support the rapid growth of cloud computing. It also signals progress for QTS in executing its h...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 5:\nTitle: New Data Center Developments: January 2025\nURL: https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/data-center-construction/new-data-center-developments-january-2025\nContent: ## North American Data Center Deals\n\nAnalysts’ forecasts of hundreds of billions in data center investment are materializing, with Microsoft planning an $80 billion buildout in 2025.\n\nThe company said the funds would be used to create new data centers, mainly in the US but also further afield, underscoring the intense capital requirements of AI systems.\n\nMore than half of this projected spending through June 2025 will be in the US, Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a New Year blog post. Recent AI progress is thanks to “large-scale infrastructure investments that serve as the essential foundation of AI innovation and use,” Smith wrote.\n\nWhile the news was welcomed by many as an indication of things to come in 2025, it was tempered by the announcement that Microsoft had paused construction of portions of its multibillion-dollar data center campus in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin. The tech giant received approval for the campus in November 2023.\n\nRelated:2024’s Biggest Data Center Construction Stories: A Year ...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 6:\nTitle: QTS Adds Firepower to Drive Hyperscale Data Center Profits\nURL: https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/operations-and-management/qts-adds-firepower-to-drive-mega-data-center-profits\nContent: # Bill Stoller4 Min Read\n\n## Investor Edge\n\n## About the AuthorSee more from Bill StollerNewsletter Sign-Up\n\nYou May Also Like\n\n### Editor's ChoiceAI Greenferencing wind-powered data center illustrationSustainability‘AI Greenferencing’ Model Could Transform Data Centers with Wind Power‘AI Greenferencing’ Model Could Transform Data Centers with Wind Power\n\nEdge Computing Trends: Adoption, Challenges, and Future Outlook\n\nDecoding Data Center Efficiency Metrics: A Guide to Energy and Sustainability\n\nData Center Knowledge’s 2024 Salary Report\n\nDeep Dive: Optimizing AI Data Storage Management\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 7:\nTitle: Can US infrastructure keep up with the AI economy?\nURL: https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/power-and-utilities/data-center-infrastructure-artificial-intelligence.html\nContent: The scale of AI data centers and their commensurate power needs are growing exponentially. By 2035, Deloitte estimates that power demand from AI data centers in the United States could grow more than thirtyfold, reaching 123 gigawatts, up from 4 gigawatts in 2024 (figure 1).\n\n1 AI data centers can require dramatically more energy per square foot than traditional data centers. For example, a five-acre data center augmenting central processing units with specialized graphics processing units might see its energy usage increase from 5 to 50 megawatts. 2\n\nThe leading AI infrastructure developers that are scaling data center networks globally are known as hyperscalers. Each of the top three hyperscalers’ largest US data centers currently draw less than 500 megawatts (MW) of power but the largest data centers they are constructing or planning to build are more than double to quadruple the capacities of completed projects. The largest of these are expected to require up to 2,000 MW—that is, 2 gigawatts (GW) (figure ...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 8:\nTitle: QTS Data Center Locations\nURL: https://baxtel.com/data-centers/qts-data-centers\nContent: QTS is constructing a massive datacenter on a 88 acre campus in Hillsboro.

Content: # Digital Realty M1 Data Center | Ashburn, VA

DPR was selected by Digital Realty (DLR) for its 230,000-sq.-ft. “mega scale” prototype data center. Built to host a single tenant, the project required a unique approach. DLR worked collaboratively with the tenant and project team as the design evolved and adjusted needs accordingly. The confidential end user requirements incorporated a high-density rack layout, optimizing the dollar value of each rack.... ## Project Scope

With power and cooling accounting for 80 percent of the data center operating costs, customers are trending towards this high-density layout which reduces the distance in cable runs and networks, minimizing the cooling and space footprint and resulting in increased efficiency. Every two years, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles, and the high-density layout also offers more flexibility for these future needs.

A Digital Realty data center in Northern Virginia

In Charlotte, Digital Realty filed plans last week for what would be North Carolina’s largest data center campus, GovTech reports. The 156-acre campus would house more than 3M SF of data center space across two buildings, with the two-phase project ultimately yielding as much as 400 megawatts of capacity.

The Dallas-based data center giant acquired the site, located 12 miles west of downtown Charlotte at 12899 Moore’s Chapel Road, in November for $160M, according to the Charlotte Business Journal. The parcel is undeveloped but sits next to a major logistics complex used by Amazon. Rezoning approval from the Charlotte City Council will be required for the project to move forward as planned.

Content: Digital Realty Trust paid $156 million in a series of transactions for land in Atlanta and in Charlotte, North Carolina, for data center developments as the company’s chief executive doesn’t expect a significant impact from tariffs on its current development projects.

The Texas-based real estate investment trust announced the acquisitions on Thursday as part of its first-quarter earnings release. Digital Realty said funds from operations, REITs' preferred financial metric, rose 4.8% to $570.7 million compared to the previous quarter on “robust demand across our key product segments,” CEO Andy Power said in a news release.

Data center developers continue to pursue new projects through land acquisitions, but President Donald Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum threaten to increase costs for the developments, according to industry analysts.

(TNS) — A massive data center — which would be the biggest in North Carolina— may be coming to west Charlotte if the city approves a rezoning request for the project.

Digital Realty Trust is looking to rezone 156 acres at 12899 Moores Chapel Road to allow for a 3-million-square-foot data center. The proposal was heard at Monday’s City Council rezoning meeting.

Currently, the wooded site is zoned for general industrial use with a warehouse usage space covering 1.5 million square feet, explained Collin Brown, a land use attorney with law firm Alexander Ricks who represents Digital Realty.

But Digital Realty wants to add a second floor to accommodate additional square footage that would double the scope of the data center. However, the building height and size wouldn’t increase, Brown added.

Content: Digital Realty is the biggest player in the world’s largest data center cluster in Northern Virginia. It intends to stay that way for a long time.

To secure its long-term leadership in Northern Virginia, Digital Realty plans to build the world’s largest multi-tenant data center campus on a 424-acre piece of land next to Dulles Airport, long known as the Western Lands. The Digital Dulles campus will create 7.5 million square feet of new data center space over a 15-year period.

The scope of the Digital Dulles project is revealed in documents the company recently filed with the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers. The development plan features 11 super-sized data center buildings, ranging from 525,00 square feet to as much as 766,000 square feet.

Digital Dulles reflects Digital Realty’s huge ambitions in building infrastructure to power the digital economy. The company operates a massive global platform of 280 data centers offering more than 1.2 gigawatts of commissioned space around the globe.

The company has some of the earliest buildings on data center alley, dating back nearly two decades, along with some of the largest, and is building a massive new campus right near Dulles Airport.

We visited a million-square-foot facility and toured its new construction site to understand Digital’s future in Virginia. “It's such a critical market, not only for Digital, but for the industry overall. It is the gold standard of availability zones on Earth,” company CTO Chris Sharp said.... The company operates around 600MW of IT load in Loudoun today, and is building a new ‘Digital Dulles’ campus that is planned to add another gigawatt on top. “What I think is interesting is we have almost 1,000 acres inside of the Loudoun County area, and 575 acres of that is left to develop,” Sharp said. “There's a lot of runway.”

Content: Digital Realty has reportedly downsized plans to upgrade one of its data centers in Dallas, Texas.

As reported by the Dallas Morning News and others, Digital recently filed to modify a 2021 tax agreement it had with the city for an expansion at its 2323 Bryan Street data center in Dallas.

A memo published by the city of Dallas notes Digital owns the building at 2323 Bryan Street and, in 2021, intended to make more than $100 million in capital improvements to expand both corporate staffing and data center capacity.

“However, due to unforeseen circumstances and technical challenges related to the expansion of the data center capacity, Digital no longer intends to move forward with more than $100 million in capital investment,” the memo said. “Instead, Digital has completed a small renovation of approximately $13 million.”

In March 2025, Digital submitted a formal request to the Texas Office of Economic Development seeking to amend the agreement in order to still qualify for previously approved Texas Enterpr...

The REIT that relocated its California headquarters to Austin, Texas, in 2021 told the city of Dallas it no longer plans to invest $100 million into its downtown Dallas tower because of "unforeseen circumstances and technical challenges" related to the expansion of its data center capacity, according to a city document.

The Dallas City Council plans to talk at its Wednesday meeting about amending Digital Realty's economic incentive agreement it received in 2021.

Digital Realty’s new project at 330 East Cermak will be a 12-story data center, allowing low latency connections to the critical mass of networks providers housed next door at 350 East Cermark, the primary data hub in downtown Chicago. The expansion aligns with Digital Realty’s connected campus strategy of bringing together real estate and network services by creating data centers adjacent to Internet on-ramps.... “With the expansion of our Cermak flagship, Digital Realty will be even better positioned to future-proof our customers’ growth, while simultaneously satisfying their most performance-sensitive requirements,” said William Stein, the CEO of Digital Realty.

URL: https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/site-selection/article/11431129/report-digital-realty-expanding-in-chicago-suburbs
Content: Digital Realty is expanding its presence in the suburban Chicago market. The company has acquired a former Motorola headquarters building next to its existing data center campus in West Franklin Park, according to Crain’s Chicago Business, and plans to build additional capacity on the 18.5 acre property.

The deal would provide more room to grow for Digital Realty, which has already filled two large data center buildings at its Digital Chicago development and is building a third.

The company has leased about 27 megawatts of capacity at the campus in Franklin Park, which is just south of O’Hare Airport, about a 30-minute drive West of downtown Chicago. The newest building will provide an additional 12.8 megawatts of commissioned power.

It’s the latest example of how data center providers are buying property to ensure they can continue to support the rapid growth of cloud computing and other emerging technologies. Similar activity is being seen in two other leading Noth American data center markets, in Northe...

Content: The biggest player in the Silicon Valley data center market is about to get bigger. Digital Realty will build a new data center adjacent to its cluster of facilities in Santa Clara, the company announced this morning.

The company will invest $75 million to build a six-megawatt data center at 3205 Alfred Street in Santa Clara, which is scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of 2018. The new inventory arrives as Silicon Valley is facing a shortage of data center space, with a limited number of large footprints for hyperscale providers.

Digital Realty’s Silicon Valley portfolio spans 17 properties, more than 2 million square feet of space and 99 megawatts of IT load, all in close proximity to three Silicon Valley Power sub-stations. The company’s Santa Clara facilities are almost fully leased, prompting the need for additional inventory. The new Alfred Street location is near the heart of that cluster of facilities, which is anchored by one of the Valley’s major connectivity hubs at 1100 Space Park Drive....

Content: DATA CENTER MARKET UPDATE - November 2024
The data center market continues to benefit from growing demand for Cloud computing, particularly from 
AI ventures. Digital Realty announced record leasing activity in 3Q24 with greater than 1 MW 
connections as the primary driver, however, the 0-1 MW segment also posted record bookings in the 
quarter. Strong demand and the inelastic supply due to the long lead time to construct new inventory has 
driven vacancy to historic lows and caused rental rates to jump. CBRE and JLL both report vacancy rates 
in North America in the 3.0% range. Digital Realty and Iron Mountain, two large public data center 
operators in the U.S., recently reported significant pre-leasing of inventory under construction in North 
America. According to 3Q24 earnings releases, Digital Realty currently has 344 MW under construction 
of which 97% is pre-leased; and Iron Mountain currently has 162 MW under construction of which 99% is 
pre-leased.

Title: Equinix Aims to Raise $15 Billion for AI Data Centers - Futuriom
URL: https://www.futuriom.com/articles/news/equinix-aims-to-raise-15-billion-for-ai-data-centers/2024/10
Content: Datacenter facilities market leader Equinix (Nasdaq: EQIX) has entered a limited liability joint venture (JV) with GIC, a sovereign wealth fund based in Singapore, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) to raise at least $15 billion for building out hyperscale datacenters in the U.S.

The joint venture’s goal is to build multiple Equinix xScale datacenters specifically to meet the requirements of cloud providers such as AWS, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, which account for a significant portion of Equinix’s 10,000-plus customer base. These datacenters, typically funded by Equinix JVs, consume more power than the company’s flagship International Business Exchange (IBX) datacenters, which offer colocation facilities for enterprise use.

Indeed, xScale datacenters significantly increase the amount of megawatts of power required per facility. And according to Equinix’s press release, “With the capital raised through the JV, Equinix expects the JV to purchase land to build new state-of-the-ar...

URL: https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/hyperscale/article/33037300/equinix-will-bring-xscale-hyperscale-data-centers-to-the-us
Content: Equinix wants a bigger piece of the hyperscale data center market in North America. The digital infrastructure company will be building out its hyperscale design in selected U.S. markets.

The Equinix hyperscale business segment, known as xScale, is gaining strategic importance as the growth of AI boosts demand for advanced cooling and fast access to cloud platforms. In its earnings call last week, the company said its accelerating investment in its xScale portfolio, including in the United States.

“The wave of hyperscale demand to support AI and cloud is translating into robust demand in pre-leasing activity (for xScale),” said Equinix CEO Charles Meyers. “We have a meaningful pipeline of opportunities to drive continued xScale momentum in the quarters to come.”

Until now, Equinix has only built its xScale data centers in Europe and Asia, where competition for hyperscale deployments is less intense than in the North American market.

But Equinix is now ready to bring xScale to America, and will soon open i...

Back in April 2024 Equinix pushed its global data center portfolio to over $8 billion with the announcement of a $600 million joint venture with PGIM Real Estate, the real estate investment and financing arm of PGIM, Prudential Financial's global asset management business.

This was the second joint venture between the two companies, though it marked the first investment made through PGIM Real Estate's dedicated global data center strategy, managed on behalf of third-party clients, to invest exclusively in hyperscale facilities.

This early 2024 investment took Equinix to more than 35 data centers globally and more than 725 MW of power capacity for its customers.

But this October’s announcement from Equinix on their latest joint venture makes April’s announcement look small, with the news of a joint venture (JV) agreement, subject to closing conditions, in the form of a limited liability pa...

The Redwood City, California-based company reported its second-quarter financial earnings on August 7, detailing its strategic focus on both traditional retail data center offerings and hyperscale facilities.

Equinix reported Q2 2024 revenues reached $2.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year. The company is also optimistic about its future performance, raising its annual revenue forecast to a range of $8.69 billion to $8.77 billion – an increase of around 7% over 2023.

These datacenters, typically funded by Equinix JVs, consume more power than the company’s flagship International Business Exchange (IBX) datacenters, which offer colocation facilities for enterprise use.\n\nIndeed, xScale datacenters significantly increase the amount of megawatts of power required per facility.

At full build-out, the partners expect to nearly triple the investment capital of xScale, which through August had raised US$4.7 billion, according to Equinix.\n\nRobust demand from cloud computing and artificial intelligence led to a significant increase in data center construction in the first half of the year, according to CBRE research.\n\nWith the capital raised, Equinix expects the joint venture to purchase land to build new xScale facilities on multiple greater-than-100-megawatt campuses, eventually adding more than 1.5 gigawatts of new capacity f...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 10:\nTitle: xScale\'s Krupal Raval is giving Equinix the X factor\nURL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/xscales-krupal-raval-is-giving-equinix-the-x-factor/\nContent: ## Scaling up\n\nEquinix has been building data centers under the xScale brand since 2019, when it partnered with GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, to create a joint venture to build hyperscale data centers in key European markets.\n\nThe brand has since spread around the world, with Equinix pursuing the JV model with GIC as a key partner. Together, the pair had jointly invested more than $7.5 billion in xScale-branded data centers, which have opened in countries including the UK, Japan, France, Brazil, and South Korea. On the company’s February 2025 earnings call, Equinix CEO Adaire Fox-Martin said the company had 16 xScale projects under construction around the world, which will offer customers 34,000 additional cabinets with 165MW total capacity. Total operational capacity for xScale data centers is 400MW globally, Fox-Martin added.\n\nConquering America has been a more recent ambition for xScale.

Content: Equinix wants a bigger piece of the hyperscale data center market in North America. The digital infrastructure company will be building out its hyperscale design in selected U.S. markets.

The Equinix hyperscale business segment, known as xScale, is gaining strategic importance as the growth of AI boosts demand for advanced cooling and fast access to cloud platforms. In its earnings call last week, the company said its accelerating investment in its xScale portfolio, including in the United States.

“The wave of hyperscale demand to support AI and cloud is translating into robust demand in pre-leasing activity (for xScale),” said Equinix CEO Charles Meyers. “We have a meaningful pipeline of opportunities to drive continued xScale momentum in the quarters to come.”

Until now, Equinix has only built its xScale data centers in Europe and Asia, where competition for hyperscale deployments is less intense than in the North American market.

Content: ## Equinix is working on one of its first xScale data centers in the United States

Trillions of dollars are pouring into the data center market, and the sites can’t be built fast enough. A gigawatt of capacity here, a gigawatt there. Every day, it seems like the promised scale of new sites gets bigger and bigger — in an industry tendency toward what Chip Newcom, senior director of investor relations at Equinix, jokingly calls the “bragawatts.”

Equinix has been in the data center business for almost three decades, and in the hyperscale DC business for nearly eight years, focused on markets abroad with its xScale data center design. After lining up a joint venture in late 2024 with $15 billion in funding, the California-based company is expanding its xScale hyperscale data center business to the U.S., with a new site in the works in Hampton, Georgia, near Atlanta.

Content: Datacenter facilities market leader Equinix (Nasdaq: EQIX) has entered a limited liability joint venture (JV) with GIC, a sovereign wealth fund based in Singapore, and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments) to raise at least $15 billion for building out hyperscale datacenters in the U.S.

The joint venture’s goal is to build multiple Equinix xScale datacenters specifically to meet the requirements of cloud providers such as AWS, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, which account for a significant portion of Equinix’s 10,000-plus customer base. These datacenters, typically funded by Equinix JVs, consume more power than the company’s flagship International Business Exchange (IBX) datacenters, which offer colocation facilities for enterprise use.

Indeed, xScale datacenters significantly increase the amount of megawatts of power required per facility. And according to Equinix’s press release, “With the capital raised through the JV, Equinix expects the JV to purchase land to build new state-of-the-ar...

To deliver the first phase of a high-rise data center project that represents a first-of-its-kind facility in the U.S. for Equinix, DPR deployed the full range of its self-performing builder capabilities to successfully complete the job in July 2020.

Built on a Greenfield site just west of the Infomart Building in downtown Dallas, the DA11 Data Center project is a 230k SF, phased four-story tower with approximately 14MW of critical load distributed to the floor when fully built out. Future phases of work include a second four-story facility similar to the first tower without the additional administration space.

## A Strong and Unified Approach

The DPR team knew they needed a strong, unified approach to complete the$90 million project within an aggressive initial 14-month schedule. A major player in this, and a majority of DPR projects of this magnitude, is the utilization of self-perform building crews. DPR Concrete provided the customer many key solutions to unexp...

The digital infrastructure company will be building out its hyperscale design in selected U.S. markets.\n\nThe Equinix hyperscale business segment, known as xScale, is gaining strategic importance as the growth of AI boosts demand for advanced cooling and fast access to cloud platforms. In its earnings call last week, the company said its accelerating investment in its xScale portfolio, including in the United States.\n\n“The wave of hyperscale demand to support AI and cloud is translating into robust demand in pre-leasing activity (for xScale),” said Equinix CEO Charles Meyers. “We have a meaningful pipeline of opportunities to drive continued xScale momentum in the quarters to come.”\n\nUntil now, Equinix has only built its xScale data centers in Europe and Asia, where competition for hyperscale deployments is less intense than in the North American market.\n\nBut Equinix is now ready to bring xScale to America, and will soon open i...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 4:\nTitle: Equinix Data Center Locations, History, and Company Profile\nURL: https://baxtel.com/data-centers/equinix\nContent: SY9x, Equinix\'s first xScale data center in Sydney, is located in Rosehill, near the Western Sydney CBD of Parramatta.\n\nThe site was formerly known as "Q9 Winnipeg" which was acquired by Equinix from Bell Canada in 2020.\n\nSG5 is a nine-story facility located at the Tanjong Kling data center park.

A gigawatt of capacity here, a gigawatt there. Every day, it seems like the promised scale of new sites gets bigger and bigger — in an industry tendency toward what Chip Newcom, senior director of investor relations at Equinix, jokingly calls the “bragawatts.”\n\nEquinix has been in the data center business for almost three decades, and in the hyperscale DC business for nearly eight years, focused on markets abroad with its xScale data center design. After lining up a joint venture in late 2024 with $15 billion in funding, the California-based company is expanding its xScale hyperscale data center business to the U.S., with a new site in the works in Hampton, Georgia, near Atlanta.\n\nTiffany Osias is the managing director of Equinix’s xScale business.

These datacenters, typically funded by Equinix JVs, consume more power than the company’s flagship International Business Exchange (IBX) datacenters, which offer colocation facilities for enterprise use.\n\nIndeed, xScale datacenters significantly increase the amount of megawatts of power required per facility.
