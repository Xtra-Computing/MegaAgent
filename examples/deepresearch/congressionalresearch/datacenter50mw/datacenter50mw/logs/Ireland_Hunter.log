Data Centres are one of the most important factors in maintaining technological advancement, business capacity, and the everyday benefits we’ve all come to expect. These aspects of our expanding society come at the expense of high energy consumption as well as the need for more and more comprehensive data centres to meet ever-increasing demands. Project activity post-Covid has an increase due to higher requirements due to business needs and consumer demand – which is also causing the energy sector to both bolster supply as well as accelerate investment in renewable energy sources to meet sustainability targets.

Ireland has a well-established history in the data sector, with over 60 years of experience and more than a decade of hosting data centres. The nation’s journey began in the 1960s with mainframes and continued through the 1990s when Ireland became a leading software exporter with the advent of floppy disks (Cross-Guard, 2023). Data centres have been operating in Ireland since the late 1990s but, from 2010 on, in line with the increase in technological advancements and the growth of smartphone technology, there was a need for increased data centre use(Ryan Christensen, 2024).

Today, Ireland remains at the forefront of the data industry, facilitating data exports through its advanced fibre networks and state-of-the-art data centres. The country’s longstanding and strong relationships with multinational corporations have been instrumental in positioning Ireland as a premier destination for data hosting (Cross-Guard, 2023).

Content: Dozens of data centres humming at the outskirts of Dublin are consuming more electricity than all of the urban homes in Ireland. And now they are starting to wear out the warm welcome that brought them here. Ireland is a country that made itself a computing factory for Amazon Google, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok. It is wondering whether it was all worth it as tech giants look around the world to build even more data centres to fuel the next wave of artificial intelligence. Fears of rolling blackouts led Ireland's grid operator to halt new data centres near Dublin until 2028. These huge buildings and their powerful computers last year consumed 21% of the nation's electricity, according to official records. No other country has reported a higher burden to the International Energy Agency. Not only that, but Ireland is still heavily reliant on burning fossil fuels to generate electricity, despite a growing number of wind farms sprouting across the countryside.

Content: AWS is reportedly restricting the number of resources users can access in Ireland amid ongoing concerns about the amount of power consumed by the nation’s data centers.

Amazon’s cloud platform is periodically limiting access to its Ireland-based eu-west-1 region, according to a report in The Register. Energy-intensive instances, such as those where GPUs are deployed to run AI workloads, are said to be particularly impacted by the restrictions.

The Register quotes an affected AWS user, who said: "You cannot spin up GPU nodes in AWS Dublin as those locations are maxed out power-wise.”

They added: “There is reserved capacity for EC2 just in case. If you have a problem with that, AWS Europe will point you at spare capacity in Sweden and other parts of the EU."

*DCD* has contacted AWS for comment on the report, but a spokesperson for the company told The Register: "Ireland remains core to our global infrastructure strategy, and we will continue to work with customers to understand their needs and help them to ...

Content: Three data centers AWS plans to build in Dublin, Ireland, will have no ‘significant impact on climate,’ it has been claimed.

Local councillors have granted planning permission for the trio of data centers, located in northwest Dublin on Cruiserath Road, but an appeal against the decision has been lodged by opponents. If built, the facilities would offer a total gross floor area of 42,589 sqm (458,424 sq ft).

AWS secured planning permission from the Fingal County Council in 2023. However, environmental campaigners appealed the decision, meaning Irish planning body An Coimisiun Pleanala (ACP) will make a final decision on whether to give the development the green light.

According to The Irish Times, John Spain Associates, the planning consulting firm working on behalf of an AWS-affiliated firm, Universal Developers LLC, said: “The proposed development involves significant and effective measures to mitigate climate impact, and the result is a development which will have no significant impact on climate.”

Content: Three data centers AWS plans to build in Dublin, Ireland, will have no ‘significant impact on climate,’ it has been claimed.

Local councillors have granted planning permission for the trio of data centers, located in northwest Dublin on Cruiserath Road, but an appeal against the decision has been lodged by opponents. If built, the facilities would offer a total gross floor area of 42,589 sqm (458,424 sq ft).

AWS secured planning permission from the Fingal County Council in 2023. However, environmental campaigners appealed the decision, meaning Irish planning body An Coimisiun Pleanala (ACP) will make a final decision on whether to give the development the green light.

According to The Irish Times, John Spain Associates, the planning consulting firm working on behalf of an AWS-affiliated firm, Universal Developers LLC, said: “The proposed development involves significant and effective measures to mitigate climate impact, and the result is a development which will have no significant impact on climate.”

URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/microsoft-shifting-data-center-focus-away-from-ireland-due-to-lack-of-power-availability-report/
Content: A Microsoft executive has said that a lack of power access in Ireland is leading the company to refocus its data center investment towards the Nordics.

As reported by Bisnow, Microsoft VP of lease and land global, Val Walsh, said that Ireland had lost its early mover advantage in the sector due to chronic grid issues, which have led to data center development in the country being stifled.

“The people who own the grids haven’t been able to keep up,” Walsh told attendees at Bisnow Data Centre Investment Conference and Expo (DICE): Ireland. “Power. We look at power before anything else,” she said. “European regulations and planning are very slow, and things take 18 months longer than anywhere else.”

Data centers in Ireland currently consume an outsized percentage of its electricity, accounting for 21 percent of total metered electricity in 2023. As a result, the country’s grid operator EirGrid enacted a de facto moratorium on new data center builds in Dublin, which is expected to last until at least 2028.

Content: # Ireland clears path for EdgeConneX data centers with conditions on energy use

Ireland’s planning body has overturned a local council’s refusal, granting conditional approval for two EdgeConneX data centers in South Dublin. The 15,000 sqm facilities will proceed only if backup generators are powered by renewable fuel, underscoring growing scrutiny on the sector’s energy footprint.

The reversal highlights the rising tension between Ireland’s role as a hub for hyperscale infrastructure and mounting public concern over power demand – with data centers consuming 21% of total electricity in 2023. EdgeConneX secured approval by demonstrating grid connection, energy efficiency measures, and engagement with power purchase agreements.

The decision contrasts with recent setbacks faced by other operators, including Vantage, AWS and even community appeals led by public figures, signalling a stricter but more structured approach to balancing growth and sustainability in the sector.

Title: EdgeConneX appeals Dublin data center rejection

Content: EdgeConneX Ireland has lodged an appeal with An Bord Pleanála against South Dublin County Council's rejection of its data center proposal.

The company was seeking to develop two adjoining data centers on its Dublin Campus on Newcastle Road in the town of Ballmakaily in Lucan, Dublin. The data centers were proposed as two single-story facilities covering a total floor space of 15,000 sqm (161,500 sq ft) along with 24 backup diesel generators.

The Dublin campus spans 22 hectares and has space for up to five more data centers at the site, according to EdgeConneX.

The basis for the rejection, according to South Dublin County Council, was that there was insufficient capacity in the grid and that EdgeConneX did not have a fixed connection agreement in place. Additional concerns surrounded the lack of on-site renewable energy and power purchase agreements in the country.... In the appeal, EdgeConneX argues that the council is taking an "unduly rigid approach" to its development plan and had misinterpreted the pro...

The 15,000 sqm facilities will proceed only if backup generators are powered by renewable fuel, underscoring growing scrutiny on the sector’s energy footprint.\n\nThe reversal highlights the rising tension between Ireland’s role as a hub for hyperscale infrastructure and mounting public concern over power demand – with data centers consuming 21% of total electricity in 2023. EdgeConneX secured approval by demonstrating grid connection, energy efficiency measures, and engagement with power purchase agreements.\n\nThe decision contrasts with recent setbacks faced by other operators, including Vantage, AWS and even community appeals led by public figures, signalling a stricter but more structured approach to balancing growth and sustainability in the sector.\n\nRead the full article for deeper in...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 4:\nTitle: EdgeConneX appeals Dublin data center rejection\nURL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/edgeconnex-appeals-dublin-data-center-rejection/\nContent: EdgeConneX Ireland has lodged an appeal with An Bord Pleanála against South Dublin County Council\'s rejection of its data center proposal.\n\nThe company was seeking to develop two adjoining data centers on its Dublin Campus on Newcastle Road in the town of Ballmakaily in Lucan, Dublin. The data centers were proposed as two single-story facilities covering a total floor space of 15,000 sqm (161,500 sq ft) along with 24 backup diesel generators.\n\nThe Dublin campus spans 22 hectares and has space for up to five more data centers at the site, according to EdgeConneX.\n\nThe basis for the rejection, according to South Dublin County Council, was that there was insufficient capacity in the grid and that EdgeConneX did not have a fixed connection agreement in place. Additional concerns surrounded the lack of on-site renewable energy and power purchase agreements in the country....

## Using local businesses

We believe the benefits of digital infrastructure should flow directly into the communities where we build and operate. That’s why we prioritise local businesses in both construction and day-to-day operations. From civil engineering firms and electrical contractors to catering suppliers and maintenance providers, our campuses support hundreds of SMEs who gain stable, long-term contracts. In Dublin, 80% of suppliers are Irish-owned, and in London we work with local charities and small businesses to deliver services on site. By embedding local firms in our supply chain, we help them grow skills and capacity that can be exported regionally and globally.

Ireland has emerged as a leading European hub for the data centre industry, with significant investments and data centre projects underway across the country.

This rapid expansion is creating a wealth of opportunities for skilled professionals and driving economic growth. Let’s delve into some of the most prominent projects shaping Ireland’s technological landscape.... ### Vantage

**Location:** Grange Castle, Dublin

Vantage Data Centres is constructing a massive 405,000 sq ft (38,000 sqm) campus in Grange Castle, Dublin. The campus will initially house two data centres with a combined capacity of 52MW, with plans for further expansion. The project is a significant investment of €1 billion ($1.07bn) and is expected to create over 1,100 jobs during peak construction and 165 permanent roles.

URL: https://www.roscommonherald.ie/planned-1-5bn-data-centre-in-ennis-at-risk-due-to-bureaucratic-inertia_arid-55194.html
Content: Gordon Deegan

The operator of the planned €1.5 billion data campus for Ennis has claimed that the project is being put at risk due to "bureaucratic inertia".

An Bord Pleanála granted planning permission to Art Data Centres Ltd for the scheme in April 2024, comprising six data halls covering 145 acres or 1.3m sq ft on lands adjacent to the Tulla Rd on the eastern outskirts of Ennis near Junction 13 on the M18 motorway connecting Galway to Limerick.

The planned data centre has been stalled by a High Court judicial review challenge by opponents of the data centre, Colin Doyle, Friends of the Irish Environment CLG, Futureproof Clare, Martin Knox and Christine Sharp.

However, last month the High Court ruled that an issue concerning a Leisler bat is not sufficient to halt contentious plans for the new 200MW data centre campus.

The High Court action remains before the High Court with an issue concerning a derogation licence still to be decided upon.

Content: €1.2 Billion Data Centre Campus Approved in Ennis: Boost to Local Economy

An Bord Pleanala has granted approval for a new €1.2 billion data centre campus in Ennis, marking a significant milestone for the region. The project, spearheaded by Art Data Centres Ltd, is set to create hundreds of new jobs and play a crucial role in the area’s economic development.

The approved Ennis data centre campus, set to be developed on 145 acres of land near Junction 13 on the M18 motorway, will consist of six data halls covering an extensive 1.3 million square feet. This strategic location on the outskirts of Ennis positions the campus as a vital hub connecting Galway to Limerick.

Economic Impact and Job Creation:

Upon completion, the data centre campus is expected to generate between 400-450 permanent jobs, with an additional 1,200 jobs during the construction phase spanning six years. This influx of employment opportunities is poised to significantly benefit the local community and boost economic growth in the region.

Data Centres are one of the most important factors in maintaining technological advancement, business capacity, and the everyday benefits we’ve all come to expect. These aspects of our expanding society come at the expense of high energy consumption as well as the need for more and more comprehensive data centres to meet ever-increasing demands. Project activity post-Covid has an increase due to higher requirements due to business needs and consumer demand – which is also causing the energy sector to both bolster supply as well as accelerate investment in renewable energy sources to meet sustainability targets.

Content: ### Vantage

**Location:** Grange Castle, Dublin

Vantage Data Centres is constructing a massive 405,000 sq ft (38,000 sqm) campus in Grange Castle, Dublin. The campus will initially house two data centres with a combined capacity of 52MW, with plans for further expansion. The project is a significant investment of €1 billion ($1.07bn) and is expected to create over 1,100 jobs during peak construction and 165 permanent roles.

**Project Value and Economic Impact**

The €1 billion investment in the Vantage Data Centres campus highlights the substantial economic impact of data centre development in Ireland. The project is expected to generate significant tax revenue for the government and contribute to the local economy through job creation and increased spending.

**Project Timeline**... The first phase of the campus is scheduled for completion by the end of 2023. However, Vantage is appealing a decision to refuse permission for a third data hall, which could potentially delay the overall project timeline.

Content: Google has been denied planning permission for another data center in Dublin, Ireland.

As reported by local press including RTE and the Irish Business Post and Times, South Dublin County Council has refused Google’s request for planning permission for a new building at the Grange Castle Business Park in south Dublin.

The council cited what it called “the existing insufficient capacity in the electricity network (grid) and the lack of significant on-site renewable energy to power the data center” as reasons for refusal.

It added that the lack of clarity around Google’s Power Purchase Agreements in Ireland and the lack of a connection to the surrounding district heating network were also factors in its decision.

Google filed to build a 72,400 sqm (779,310 sq ft) facility on a 50-acre site, adjacent to the two facilities it already has there, in June 2024.

Google originally sought ten-year planning permission for the expansion of its existing operations at Grange Castle Business Park South, Dublin, including the development of a third, 72,400 sqm data centre.

The council’s decision also cited the lack of on-site renewable energy solutions in Google’s application, stating the rejection takes into account the “existing insufficient capacity in the electricity network (grid), the lack of significant on-site renewable energy to power (below 100%) the proposed development, the lack of clarity provided in relation to the applicant’s engagement with Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) in Ireland with regard the development in question rather than the site or wider arrangements in place, the lack of a connection to the surrounding district heating network, the proposed design of the development as well as...

The company has informed local press including the Irish Times and Independent that it intends to apply for planning permission with South Dublin County Council to extend its existing campus at the Grange Castle Business Park.

Google wants to build a 72,400 sqm (779,310 sq ft) facility at the Grange Castle business park, adjacent to the two facilities it already has there.

South Dublin County Council has refused Google Ireland planning permission for a new data-centre at Grange Castle Business Park in South Dublin.

**Why? **

The reason given for the refusal was

*“the existing insufficient capacity in the electricity network (grid) and the lack of significant on-site renewable energy to power the data centre”. *

**What Data Centre? **

Google already has two data-centres in South Dublin’s Grange Castle business park, and had submitted plans to build a third 72,400sq-metre data-centre consisting of eight data halls on a 50-acre site. This new data-centre would have created 50 jobs and documents lodged with the application by Google Ireland had highlighted how important the new data-centre would be for Google being able to meet the increasing demands for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) services to its customers in Ireland and in supporting Ireland’s digital economy.
