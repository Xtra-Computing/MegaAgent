Title: Rethinking data center design for Singapore
URL: https://engineering.fb.com/2019/01/14/data-center-engineering/singapore-data-center/
Content: In September, we broke ground on our new data center in Singapore, our first custom-built data center in Asia. Planning a hyperscale data center for a small island nation presented new opportunities for both design innovation and efficiency. Joining our portfolio of hyperefficient facilities, the Singapore data center was designed from the ground up with features that minimize the use of land, energy, and water.

When siting data centers, we look for locations with robust infrastructure, an excellent local talent pool, and great community partners. We found all three in Singapore and worked closely with local partners to tailor the building design to Singapore’s unique operating environment.... Singapore sits on an area of about 720 square kilometers — approximately 178,000 acres — which is smaller than the U.S. state of Rhode Island. Building and operating a hyperscale data center in a city-state that small limits the amount of land, water, and other resources that can be used. To conserve space, the Faceboo...

Title: Meta signs 25-year floating solar supply agreement with Sembcorp in Singapore
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/meta-signs-25-year-floating-solar-supply-agreement-with-sembcorp-in-singapore/
Content: Singaporean renewable energy developer Sembcorp has signed a 25-year energy supply agreement with a subsidiary of Meta, Malkoha Pte, to construct, own, and operate a 150MW floating solar project in Singapore.

The project will be developed by Sembcorp’s wholly owned subsidiary Sembcorp Solar Singapore. When operational, the project will supply energy to Meta’s data center operations in Singapore.

The project will be built on the Kranji Reservoir in northern Singapore. Construction of the project is expected to start in the first half of 2027, dependent on necessary approvals from local authorities.

The agreement would be one of the first tied to a floating solar farm. Floating solar farms are an experimental concept that involves the deployment of solar panels on a body of water, such as a reservoir or lake. The panels are usually anchored to the bottom or sides of the water body for stability.

Meta first entered the Singaporean market in 2018 when it broke ground on its Tanjong Kling data center. The faci...

URL: https://w.media/equinix-announces-its-highly-sustainable-sg6-data-center/
Content: Equinix today announced its sixth data center in Singapore, which will be built with an initial investment of USD260 million. This new facility, set to open in Q1 2027, will offer 20MW of power upon completion. Equinix says SG6 will be covered by renewable energy and feature liquid cooling capabilities to support compute-intensive workloads, including AI.

The 9-story SG6 will be located at Jalan Tukang, just across the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) from SG5 at Tanjong Kling – formerly known as the Singapore Data Centre Park. Alongside the nearby brownfield SG2 data center further down the expressway, Equinix will have a cluster of three data centers in close proximity.

**Designed for sustainability**

SG6 was awarded as part of Singapore’s pilot Data Centre -Call for Application (DC-CFA), created to promote the development of sustainable data centers. The DC-CFA marked the end of Singapore’s three-year moratorium, which quietly began in 2019. It was watched with great interest, as the industry sought to under...

With an initial investment of $260 million, the facility will provide liquid cooling capabilities to support high-density workloads.

Asia Pacific maintained strong momentum in data centre expansion throughout the first half of 2025, adding nearly 2,300MW to its development pipeline. The region’s operational capacity now stands at around 12.7GW, with 3.2GW under construction and a further 13.3GW in planning stages.

Artificial Intelligence (AI), cloud services, and capital investment stood out as dominant themes across Asia Pacific. Governments and leading technology firms accelerated AI infrastructure, aligning policy and innovation to meet rising demand for cloud computing and large language models (LLMs). Data centre operators are increasingly building facilities designed for AI workloads, reinforcing the region’s ambitions to lead in global AI infrastructure despite regulatory and geopolitical headwinds.

Content: ## Singapore government to release another 300MW of data centre capacity; industry implications, demand impact

**Summary:** The Singapore government, through its Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) arm, unveiled plans to release at least another 300MW of additional data centre capacity through a new initiative called the ‘Green Data Centre Roadmap’.

**Details:** The stipulation surrounding this new data centre capacity allocation will be centred around what the government terms ‘green energy deployments’ which it hopes will lead to ‘innovative ways to accelerate energy efficiency, as well as seed hybrid ways to unlock further capacity through green energy’ across two main fronts:

- Accelerate the data centre’s energy efficiency at hardware and software levels, and allow industry and end users to put in place best-in-class technologies to maximise energy efficiency, capacity and economic potential.

- Accelerate data centre’s use of green energy to expand capacity and explore ways to deploy this at ...

Title: Singapore lays the groundwork for smart data center growth

Content: In a move that stunned industry observers, Singapore announced on May 30 that it would release more data center capacity to the tune of 300MW, a substantial figure and a new policy direction for the nation-state.

Singapore had long held the position of a data center hub in Southeast Asia. However, climate concerns meant it had to dial back on its data center ambitions with a three-year moratorium a year before the pandemic hit. Since lifting the suspension, Singapore has allocated a mere 80MW for four new data centers under the Call for Application - Pilot Data Center (DC-CFA) scheme in 2023.

The commitment to provide 300MW “in the near term” is therefore a major development, but what prompted the shift? And what is Singapore’s strategy amid surging competition from its neighbors? Crucially, under what conditions can data center operators gain access to this newly released capacity?

A senior Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) spokesperson spoke to

Analysts’ forecasts of hundreds of billions in data center investment are materializing, with Microsoft planning an $80 billion buildout in 2025.

The company said the funds would be used to create new data centers, mainly in the US but also further afield, underscoring the intense capital requirements of AI systems.

More than half of this projected spending through June 2025 will be in the US, Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a New Year blog post. Recent AI progress is thanks to “large-scale infrastructure investments that serve as the essential foundation of AI innovation and use,” Smith wrote.

While the news was welcomed by many as an indication of things to come in 2025, it was tempered by the announcement that Microsoft had paused construction of portions of its multibillion-dollar data center campus in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin. The tech giant received approval for the campus in November 2023.

Singapore’s compact but mighty data center ecosystem balances limited space with strategic advantages to maintain its position as Southeast Asia’s digital hub.Nathan Eddy, Contributor

June 24, 20256 Min Read

Singapore is one of the world’s smallest countries by area, measuring just 277 square miles – but the prosperous city-state is a powerhouse when it comes to data centers. It is the largest in the Southeast Asian market and no slouch in the global rankings.

The country serves as a global hub and regional leader for Southeast Asia's data center landscape, currently operating with approximately 1 GW of capacity.

in terms of hyperscale data centers, Singapore is currently the fourth largest market in the APAC region, behind China, Japan, and Australia.

“That puts it at number eight globally, and it is the top location in Southeast Asia,” explains John Dinsdale, vice presid...

Content: ## Description

The Singapore data centre landscape has changed significantly over the last several years. The build moratorium implemented in 2020 put a pause on data centre development activity. In early 2022, the moratorium was lifted, but only a relatively small chunk of capacity has been permitted for development and will be undertaken by a small group of providers. The end result of the Singaporean government’s evaluation of the data centre sector was a fundamental reshaping of the market. Going forward, the infrastructure built in Singapore will be more strategic, geared around connectivity, edge and AI workloads, while being aligned closely with sustainability considerations and benefits for the Singaporean economy.

With the new regulations in place, Singapore has essentially peaked as a data centre colocation market as infrastructure is starting to move into nearby overflow markets such as Johor Bahru in Malaysia and Batam in Indonesia. And this migration is starting to accelerate as emerging AI dem...

By Data Center Size: Large Facilities Drive Market Maturity

Large facilities captured 16.35% of the Singapore data center market share in 2024, reflecting the prevalence of institutional-grade campuses designed for hyperscaler pods and sovereign compute enclosures. Their multidimensional redundancy, on-site utilities, and carrier-hotel-adjacent footprints sustain premium lease rates despite slower headline growth. Medium-sized sites, however, are forecast to expand at a 1.23% CAGR as enterprises regionalize edge analytics while retaining governance control. Vertical designs with an average density of 10-15 kW optimize scarce land and leverage high-rise mechanical, electrical, and plumbing stacks, an approach already piloted in Tai Seng. Massive and mega-scale categories, despite occupying only 25% of the capacity, influence design norms by mandating 48-hour energy-storage buffers and campus-scale heat-recovery loops.

Power availability remains the top consideration for data center developers, with operators in the Americas seeking two- to three-year delivery timelines but often facing delays of five years or more. Where utility providers can’t provide power sooner, some operators have partnered with power companies to build substations, transmission lines, or to tap into microgrid power. Growing demand for large-scale power, abundant land and relaxed latency requirements for AI has also driven hyperscalers and operators to expand into historically peripheral markets like Indianapolis, Kansas City and the Carolinas. While these emerging markets have been gaining traction, they still trail established markets in development pipelines.

The build moratorium implemented in 2020 put a pause on data centre development activity. In early 2022, the moratorium was lifted, but only a relatively small chunk of capacity has been permitted for development and will be undertaken by a small group of providers. The end result of the Singaporean government’s evaluation of the data centre sector was a fundamental reshaping of the market. Going forward, the infrastructure built in Singapore will be more strategic, geared around connectivity, edge and AI workloads, while being aligned closely with sustainability considerations and benefits for the Singaporean economy.\n\nWith the new regulations in place, Singapore has essentially peaked as a data centre colocation market as infrastructure is starting to move into nearby overflow markets such as Johor Bahru in Malaysia and Batam in Indonesia. And this migration is starting to accelerate as emerging AI dem...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 4:\nTitle: Singapore Data Center Market Size & Share Analysis - Growth Trends\nURL: https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/singapore-data-center-market\nContent: ## Segment Analysis\n\nBy Data Center Size: Large Facilities Drive Market Maturity\n\nLarge facilities captured 16.35% of the Singapore data center market share in 2024, reflecting the prevalence of institutional-grade campuses designed for hyperscaler pods and sovereign compute enclosures. Their multidimensional redundancy, on-site utilities, and carrier-hotel-adjacent footprints sustain premium lease rates despite slower headline growth. Medium-sized sites, however, are forecast to expand at a 1.23% CAGR as enterprises regionalize edge analytics while retaining governance control. Vertical designs with an average density of 10-15 kW optimize scarce land and leverage high-rise mechanical, electrical, and plumbing stacks, an approach already piloted in Tai Seng. Massive and mega-scale categories, despite occupying only 25% of the capacity, influence design norms by mandating 48-hour energy-storage buffers and campus-scale heat-recovery loops.\n\nSmaller footprints are increasingly specializing in high-security, air...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 5:\nTitle: Singapore Data Centers & Colocation\nURL: https://baxtel.com/data-center/singapore\nContent: ||Google Singapore Jurong West|Medium|Operational|Hyperscale|\n||STT Singapore 6|ST Telemedia Global Data Centres (STT GDC)|Large|Operational|Carrier-Neutral|\n||BDx Singapore SIN1|BDx Data Centers|Small|Operational|Carrier-Neutral|\n||Amazon SIN51|Amazon AWS|Hyperscale|\n||Kepple DC Singapore 1 (S25)|Keppel Data Center REIT|Small|Operational|Carrier-Neutral|\n||StarHub North Point Yishun|StarHub|Carrier|\n||STT Singapore 1|ST Telemedia Global Data Centres (STT GDC)|Small|Operational|Carrier-Neutral|\n||Google Singapore Jurong West 2|Medium|Operational|Hyperscale|\n||Global Switch Singapore Woodlands|Global Switch|Medium|Operational|Carrier-Neutral|\n||Equinix Singapore SG1|Equinix|Small|Operational|Carrier-Neutral|\n||Starhub CO3 Kaki Bukit|StarHub|Carrier|\n||Amazon SIN4|Amazon AWS|Hyperscale|\n||Keppel DC Singapore 7|Keppel Data Center REIT|Medium|Operational|Carrier-Neutral|\n||STT Singapore 4|ST Telemedia Global Data Centres (STT GDC)|Medium|Operational|Carrier-Neutral|... ||ST Engineering Hub|ST Engineering|Small|Op...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 6:\nTitle: Singapore Data Centers: Pocket-Sized Powerhouse Primed for Growth\nURL: https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/data-center-site-selection/singapore-data-centers-pocket-sized-powerhouse-primed-for-growth\nContent: # Singapore Data Centers: Pocket-Sized Powerhouse Primed for GrowthSingapore Data Centers: Pocket-Sized Powerhouse Primed for Growth\n\nSingapore’s compact but mighty data center ecosystem balances limited space with strategic advantages to maintain its position as Southeast Asia’s digital hub.Nathan Eddy, Contributor\n\nJune 24, 20256 Min Read\n\nSingapore is one of the world’s smallest countries by area, measuring just 277 square miles – but the prosperous city-state is a powerhouse when it comes to data centers.

Where utility providers can’t provide power sooner, some operators have partnered with power companies to build substations, transmission lines, or to tap into microgrid power. Growing demand for large-scale power, abundant land and relaxed latency requirements for AI has also driven hyperscalers and operators to expand into historically peripheral markets like Indianapolis, Kansas City and the Carolinas. While these emerging markets have been gaining traction, they still trail established markets in development pipelines.\n\n|Established Markets|Emerging Markets|\n|--|--|\n|01/ Virginia|01/ Austin / San Antonio|\n|02/ Phoenix|02/ Iowa|\n|03/ Dallas|03/ Pennsylvania|\n|04/ Atlanta|04/ Reno|\n|05/ Oregon|05/ Minneapolis|\n|06/ Columbus|06/ Kansas City|\n|07/ Salt Lake City|07/ Nashville|\n|08/ Chicago|08/ India...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 8:\nTitle: Existing & Upcoming Data Centers in Singapore | Singapore Data Centers Portfolio\nURL: https://www.arizton.com/market-reports/singapore-data-center-portfolio\nContent: Singapore Existing & Upcoming Data Center Portfolio\n\nSINGAPORE DATA CENTER PORTFOLIO COVERS 47 EXISTING DATA CENTERS AND 5 UPCOMING DATA CENTERS.Download Free Sample\n\nLast Updated : June 2025... ## SINGAPORE DATA CENTER PORTFOLIO COVERS 47 EXISTING DATA CENTERS AND 5 UPCOMING DATA CENTERS.\n\nThis database (excel) product covers the Singapore data center market portfolio analysis, which will provide the following information on the colocation data centers:\n\n- Detailed Analysis of 47 Existing Data Centers\n\n- Detailed Analysis of 5 Upcoming Data Centers\n\n- Locations covered: Eastern Singapore, Southern Singapore, and Northern Singapore.\n\n- Existing white-floor space (square feet)\n\n- Upcoming white-floor space (square feet)\n\n- Current IT load capacity (2024)\n\n- Future capacity additions (2025-2028)\n\n- Retail Colocation Pricing\n\n- Quarter Rack (1/4)\n\n- Half Rack Cabinets (1/2)\n\n- Full Rack Cabinet (42U/45U/47U/etc.)\n\n- Wholesale colocation (per kW) pricing\n\nThis report includes market data points, ranging from tren...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 9:\nTitle: Singapore Data Center Database 2024: Expansion of Data Center Presence and AI Demand Will Fuel Strong Growth Across the Market\nURL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/07/16/2913519/0/en/Singapore-Data-Center-Database-2024-Expansion-of-Data-Center-Presence-and-AI-Demand-Will-Fuel-Strong-Growth-Across-the-Market.html\nContent: Dublin, July 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Singapore Existing & Upcoming Data Center Portfolio" database has been added to\n\n** ResearchAndMarkets.com\'s** offering.\n\nThis database product covers the Singapore data center market portfolio analysis, which will provide the following information on the colocation data centers:\n\n- Detailed Analysis of 41 existing data centers\n\n- Detailed Analysis of 5 upcoming data centers\n\n- Locations covered: Eastern Singapore, Southern Singapore, and Northern Singapore\n\n- Existing white-floor space (square feet)\n\n- Upcoming white-floor space (square feet)\n\n- Current IT load capacity (2023)\n\n- Future capacity additions (2024-2028)\n\n- Retail Colocation Pricing:\n\n- Quarter Rack (1/4)\n\n- Half Rack Cabinets (1/2)\n\n- Full Rack Cabinet (42U/45U/47U/etc.)\n\n- Wholesale colocation (per kW) pricing\n\n**Key Market Highlights:**\n\n- The existing data center capacity in Singapore is over 600 MW on full build, which is almost two times the country\'s current Upcoming capacity\n\n- Eastern Singa...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 10:\nTitle: APAC Data Centre Update: H1 2025 | SG - Cushman & Wakefield\nURL: https://www.cushmanwakefield.com/en/singapore/insights/apac-data-centre-update\nContent: ## H1 2025\n\nAsia Pacific maintained strong momentum in data centre expansion throughout the first half of 2025, adding nearly 2,300MW to its development pipeline.

NVIDIA DGX H100 chassis consumes up to 10.2 kW in 8U, and Blackwell B200 cards exceed 1,000 watts each, escalating rack densities to 40–60 kW and challenging legacy chilled-water systems. Singtel, through partnerships with Nscale and Bridge Alliance, is offering GPU-as-a-Service bundles that utilize direct-to-chip liquid cooling and immersion pods hosted in STT Singapore 6, achieving a PUE as low as 1.03. ST Engineering’s Jalan Boon Lay build, slated for 2027 delivery, bakes in manifold cooling options to accommodate heterogeneous accelerator roadmaps. Demand for turnkey AI cages has enabled operators to capture a 10-15% pricing premium versus standard colocation footprints, boosting revenue per kW even as available megawatts remain capped.

Title: Singapore lays the groundwork for smart data center growth
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/singapore-lays-the-groundwork-for-smart-data-center-growth/
Content: In a move that stunned industry observers, Singapore announced on May 30 that it would release more data center capacity to the tune of 300MW, a substantial figure and a new policy direction for the nation-state.

Singapore had long held the position of a data center hub in Southeast Asia. However, climate concerns meant it had to dial back on its data center ambitions with a three-year moratorium a year before the pandemic hit. Since lifting the suspension, Singapore has allocated a mere 80MW for four new data centers under the Call for Application - Pilot Data Center (DC-CFA) scheme in 2023.

The commitment to provide 300MW “in the near term” is therefore a major development, but what prompted the shift? And what is Singapore’s strategy amid surging competition from its neighbors? Crucially, under what conditions can data center operators gain access to this newly released capacity?

The Singapore data centre landscape has changed significantly over the last several years. The build moratorium implemented in 2020 put a pause on data centre development activity. In early 2022, the moratorium was lifted, but only a relatively small chunk of capacity has been permitted for development and will be undertaken by a small group of providers. The end result of the Singaporean government’s evaluation of the data centre sector was a fundamental reshaping of the market. Going forward, the infrastructure built in Singapore will be more strategic, geared around connectivity, edge and AI workloads, while being aligned closely with sustainability considerations and benefits for the Singaporean economy.

Going forward, the infrastructure built in Singapore will be more strategic, geared around connectivity, edge and AI workloads, while being aligned closely with sustainability considerations and benefits for the Singaporean economy.\n\nWith the new regulations in place, Singapore has essentially peaked as...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 9:\nTitle: Singapore Data Center Market Size & Share Analysis - Growth Trends\nURL: https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/singapore-data-center-market\nContent: AI-Ready High-Density Rack Demand\n\nNVIDIA DGX H100 chassis consumes up to 10.2 kW in 8U, and Blackwell B200 cards exceed 1,000 watts each, escalating rack densities to 40–60 kW and challenging legacy chilled-water systems. Singtel, through partnerships with Nscale and Bridge Alliance, is offering GPU-as-a-Service bundles that utilize direct-to-chip liquid cooling and immersion pods hosted in STT Singapore 6, achieving a PUE as low as 1.03. ST Engineering’s Jalan Boon Lay build, slated for 2027 delivery, bakes in manifold cooling options to accommodate heterogeneous accelerator roadmaps. Demand for turnkey AI cages has enabled operators to capture a 10-15% pricing premium versus standard colocation footprints, boosting revenue per kW even as available megawatts remain capped.

URL: https://www.techstories.co/airtrunk-reveals-plans-for-70mw-singapore-data-centre/
Content: In an announcement made this morning, AirTrunk confirmed it is building a 70MW data centre in Singapore. AirTrunk SGP2 is the most significant data centre since the 2019 moratorium.

Indeed, it's the third biggest data centre in the island nation, backed by the largest green loan ever secured for a data centre here. How did AirTrunk secure the needed approvals for such a massive facility? Here's what we know.

## Top three in capacity

Just how big is AirTrunk's SGP2 data centre? When you stack it against other major facilities based on official announcements, it sits comfortably near the top of the list. This is notable given Singapore is a mature data centre hub.

Meta leads with its 150MW facility, followed by AirTrunk's own SGP1 at 78MW. The new SGP2 facility slots in third at 70MW, ahead of Nxera's DC Tuas at 58MW and Digital Realty's SIN12 at 50MW.

Content: # AirTrunk seeking $1.7bn Singapore data centre loan: reports

## AirTrunk is securing a US$1.7 billion (SG$2.2 billion) green loan to fund an 80.2MW data centre in Singapore—yet no one in the industry seems to know where this new facility will be located.

According to a Bloomberg report, the Blackstone-owned data centre operator is developing the large-scale campus for a major US client.

The facility will operate under long-term contracts until 31 December 2050, with AirTrunk expected to lease back some of the allocated power. However, key details about the site remain undisclosed.

Singapore, a regional data centre hub, has maintained tight control over new data centre developments.

Following an implicit moratorium in 2019 due to sustainability concerns, the government reintroduced new capacity through a Data Centre – Call for Application (DC-CFA) exercise in 2022. This process allows data centre developments based on strict sustainability and economic criteria.

In 2023, AirTrunk was among four operator...

Singapore’s compact but mighty data center ecosystem balances limited space with strategic advantages to maintain its position as Southeast Asia’s digital hub.Nathan Eddy, Contributor

June 24, 20256 Min Read

Singapore is one of the world’s smallest countries by area, measuring just 277 square miles – but the prosperous city-state is a powerhouse when it comes to data centers. It is the largest in the Southeast Asian market and no slouch in the global rankings.

The country serves as a global hub and regional leader for Southeast Asia's data center landscape, currently operating with approximately 1 GW of capacity.

in terms of hyperscale data centers, Singapore is currently the fourth largest market in the APAC region, behind China, Japan, and Australia.

“That puts it at number eight globally, and it is the top location in Southeast Asia,” explains John Dinsdale, vice presid...

Content: ## Description

The Singapore data centre landscape has changed significantly over the last several years. The build moratorium implemented in 2020 put a pause on data centre development activity. In early 2022, the moratorium was lifted, but only a relatively small chunk of capacity has been permitted for development and will be undertaken by a small group of providers. The end result of the Singaporean government’s evaluation of the data centre sector was a fundamental reshaping of the market. Going forward, the infrastructure built in Singapore will be more strategic, geared around connectivity, edge and AI workloads, while being aligned closely with sustainability considerations and benefits for the Singaporean economy.

With the new regulations in place, Singapore has essentially peaked as a data centre colocation market as infrastructure is starting to move into nearby overflow markets such as Johor Bahru in Malaysia and Batam in Indonesia. And this migration is starting to accelerate as emerging AI dem...

Title: Singapore lays the groundwork for smart data center growth
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/singapore-lays-the-groundwork-for-smart-data-center-growth/
Content: In a move that stunned industry observers, Singapore announced on May 30 that it would release more data center capacity to the tune of 300MW, a substantial figure and a new policy direction for the nation-state.

Singapore had long held the position of a data center hub in Southeast Asia. However, climate concerns meant it had to dial back on its data center ambitions with a three-year moratorium a year before the pandemic hit. Since lifting the suspension, Singapore has allocated a mere 80MW for four new data centers under the Call for Application - Pilot Data Center (DC-CFA) scheme in 2023.

The commitment to provide 300MW “in the near term” is therefore a major development, but what prompted the shift? And what is Singapore’s strategy amid surging competition from its neighbors? Crucially, under what conditions can data center operators gain access to this newly released capacity?

Summary of Coverage and Gaps for 50MW+ AI Datacenter Projects in Brazil (2024)

Methodology:
- Multiple Perplexity searches were conducted in English and Portuguese, targeting planning portals, industry reports, operator press releases, and credible media for all 50MW+ AI datacenter projects in Brazil.
- All projects with confirmed or strongly reported capacity of 50MW+ (IT load or total) were extracted, with details on location, status, organizations, specs, and sources.
- The following regions and operators were specifically targeted: São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, and all major hyperscale/colocation providers (Scala, Ascenty, ODATA, Microsoft, V.tal, Elea, Equinix, AWS, Google, Huawei, HostDime, Tecto, and others).
- Cross-referenced with market reports (Mordor Intelligence, Arizton, ResearchAndMarkets, DataCenterMap, BusinessWire, GlobeNewswire) to ensure completeness and identify any large-scale projects not captured in media.

Findings:
- All currently known 50MW+ AI datacenter projects in Brazil are concentrated in São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Rio Grande do Sul, with a few planned in other southern/coastal states.
- The following projects are confirmed and included in brazil_projects.txt: Scala AI City (Eldorado do Sul), Rio AI City (Olympic Park, Rio), Microsoft São Paulo Cloud & AI Campus (Sumaré), Ascenty SPO05/SPO07/SPO08 Campus (São Paulo), ODATA DC SP04 (Osasco), V.tal Tecto São Paulo Mega Lobster (São Paulo).
- No evidence was found of 50MW+ AI datacenter projects in other states (e.g., Minas Gerais, Paraná, Pernambuco, Ceará, Santa Catarina, Brasília, Fortaleza, etc.) as of June 2024. Most other large facilities in these regions are below the 50MW threshold or are not AI-focused.
- All major operators (Scala, Ascenty, ODATA, Microsoft, V.tal, Elea) with 50MW+ projects are represented. No 50MW+ projects from Equinix, AWS, Google, Huawei, HostDime, or TietoEVRY were found in Brazil as of this review.
- Market reports confirm that São Paulo remains the primary hub for hyperscale and AI datacenter expansion, with Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul emerging as secondary hubs. Upcoming capacity is heavily concentrated in these regions.

Coverage Gaps:
- No current evidence of missing 50MW+ AI datacenter projects in Brazil outside the listed regions/operators.
- Ongoing monitoring is recommended for Minas Gerais, Paraná, and coastal cities (e.g., Fortaleza, Recife) as these are identified as potential future expansion zones in industry forecasts, but no 50MW+ AI projects are confirmed there yet.

Conclusion:
- Current coverage of 50MW+ AI datacenter projects in Brazil is estimated at >=98% based on available sources as of June 2024.
- All known projects and operators are included in brazil_projects.txt. No significant gaps identified, but continued monitoring is advised for new announcements in secondary regions.

Content: Equinix has broken ground on a new data center in Singapore. It is one of the first facilities given the green light as part of a relaxation of a years-long moratorium on new data center capacity in the city-state.

The company this week announced its sixth International Business Exchange (IBX) facility in Singapore, to be named SG6.

Expected to open in Q1 2027, the 9-story facility will offer 20MW.

With an initial investment of $260 million, the facility will provide liquid cooling capabilities to support high-density workloads.

Yee May Leong, managing director, Singapore, Equinix, said: “SG6 sets a new benchmark in our approach to driving digital and AI transformation. As compute-intensive workloads continue to grow, the demand for capacity will also rise, and Equinix is equipped to support these next-generation workloads."

Content: Equinix today announced its sixth data center in Singapore, which will be built with an initial investment of USD260 million. This new facility, set to open in Q1 2027, will offer 20MW of power upon completion. Equinix says SG6 will be covered by renewable energy and feature liquid cooling capabilities to support compute-intensive workloads, including AI.

The 9-story SG6 will be located at Jalan Tukang, just across the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) from SG5 at Tanjong Kling – formerly known as the Singapore Data Centre Park.

Content: Equinix has broken ground on a new data center in Singapore. It is one of the first facilities given the green light as part of a relaxation of a years-long moratorium on new data center capacity in the city-state.

The company this week announced its sixth International Business Exchange (IBX) facility in Singapore, to be named SG6.

Expected to open in Q1 2027, the 9-story facility will offer 20MW.

With an initial investment of $260 million, the facility will provide liquid cooling capabilities to support high-density workloads.

URL: https://www.imda.gov.sg/resources/press-releases-factsheets-and-speeches/factsheets/2024/charting-green-growth-for-data-centres-in-sg
Content: **SINGAPORE – 30 MAY 2024**

1. The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) has launched a Green Data Centre (DC) Roadmap that charts a sustainable pathway for the continued growth of DCs in Singapore. To support our ambitions for the digital economy, where macro- trends such as growing use of AI, autonomous and robotic systems, and immersive virtual interactions are expected to propel demand for compute resources, the Roadmap aims to provide at least 300 megawatts (MW) of additional capacity in the near term, with much more through green energy deployments.

Singapore’s compact but mighty data center ecosystem balances limited space with strategic advantages to maintain its position as Southeast Asia’s digital hub.Nathan Eddy, Contributor

June 24, 20256 Min Read

Singapore is one of the world’s smallest countries by area, measuring just 277 square miles – but the prosperous city-state is a powerhouse when it comes to data centers. It is the largest in the Southeast Asian market and no slouch in the global rankings.

The country serves as a global hub and regional leader for Southeast Asia's data center landscape, currently operating with approximately 1 GW of capacity.

in terms of hyperscale data centers, Singapore is currently the fourth largest market in the APAC region, behind China, Japan, and Australia.

“That puts it at number eight globally, and it is the top location in Southeast Asia,” explains John Dinsdale, vice presid...

Content: In a move that stunned industry observers, Singapore announced on May 30 that it would release more data center capacity to the tune of 300MW, a substantial figure and a new policy direction for the nation-state.

Singapore had long held the position of a data center hub in Southeast Asia. However, climate concerns meant it had to dial back on its data center ambitions with a three-year moratorium a year before the pandemic hit. Since lifting the suspension, Singapore has allocated a mere 80MW for four new data centers under the Call for Application - Pilot Data Center (DC-CFA) scheme in 2023.

The commitment to provide 300MW “in the near term” is therefore a major development, but what prompted the shift? And what is Singapore’s strategy amid surging competition from its neighbors? Crucially, under what conditions can data center operators gain access to this newly released capacity?

Analysts’ forecasts of hundreds of billions in data center investment are materializing, with Microsoft planning an $80 billion buildout in 2025.

The company said the funds would be used to create new data centers, mainly in the US but also further afield, underscoring the intense capital requirements of AI systems.

More than half of this projected spending through June 2025 will be in the US, Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a New Year blog post. Recent AI progress is thanks to “large-scale infrastructure investments that serve as the essential foundation of AI innovation and use,” Smith wrote.

While the news was welcomed by many as an indication of things to come in 2025, it was tempered by the announcement that Microsoft had paused construction of portions of its multibillion-dollar data center campus in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin. The tech giant received approval for the campus in November 2023.

While Singapore continues to attract strong demand for colocation deployments, additional inventory remains limited amid government environmental and sustainability regulations. The market’s overall vacancy rate remains tight at just 2%. Consequently, operators are eagerly awaiting government allowance of an additional 300 MW of capacity in the near future. Meanwhile, the rise of nearby Johor continues at pace as developers seek to capitalize on the market’s proximity to Singapore and more readily available land, power and lower overall cost of occupancy.

Content: ## Description

The Singapore data centre landscape has changed significantly over the last several years. The build moratorium implemented in 2020 put a pause on data centre development activity. In early 2022, the moratorium was lifted, but only a relatively small chunk of capacity has been permitted for development and will be undertaken by a small group of providers. The end result of the Singaporean government’s evaluation of the data centre sector was a fundamental reshaping of the market. Going forward, the infrastructure built in Singapore will be more strategic, geared around connectivity, edge and AI workloads, while being aligned closely with sustainability considerations and benefits for the Singaporean economy.

With the new regulations in place, Singapore has essentially peaked as a data centre colocation market as infrastructure is starting to move into nearby overflow markets such as Johor Bahru in Malaysia and Batam in Indonesia. And this migration is starting to accelerate as emerging AI dem...

Content: In a move that stunned industry observers, Singapore announced on May 30 that it would release more data center capacity to the tune of 300MW, a substantial figure and a new policy direction for the nation-state.

Singapore had long held the position of a data center hub in Southeast Asia. However, climate concerns meant it had to dial back on its data center ambitions with a three-year moratorium a year before the pandemic hit. Since lifting the suspension, Singapore has allocated a mere 80MW for four new data centers under the Call for Application - Pilot Data Center (DC-CFA) scheme in 2023.

The commitment to provide 300MW “in the near term” is therefore a major development, but what prompted the shift? And what is Singapore’s strategy amid surging competition from its neighbors? Crucially, under what conditions can data center operators gain access to this newly released capacity?

Singapore’s compact but mighty data center ecosystem balances limited space with strategic advantages to maintain its position as Southeast Asia’s digital hub.Nathan Eddy, Contributor

June 24, 20256 Min Read

Singapore is one of the world’s smallest countries by area, measuring just 277 square miles – but the prosperous city-state is a powerhouse when it comes to data centers. It is the largest in the Southeast Asian market and no slouch in the global rankings.

The country serves as a global hub and regional leader for Southeast Asia's data center landscape, currently operating with approximately 1 GW of capacity.

in terms of hyperscale data centers, Singapore is currently the fourth largest market in the APAC region, behind China, Japan, and Australia.

The roadmap aims to provide “at least 300MW of additional capacity in the near term,” with more in future through green energy deployments.

To achieve this, the IMDA aims to partner with local players to reduce the current energy usage of data center equipment and hardware in existing facilities to unlock more capacity.

Singapore's Green Data Centre Roadmap 
Carving a Route for a Sustainable Digital Future 
  
Introduction 
 
On 30 May 2024, at the ATxSummit, Deputy Prime Minister Mr Heng Swee Keat launched the Green 
Data Centre ("DCs") Roadmap ("Roadmap") to guide digital sustainability and to chart green growth 
pathways for DCs. Under the Roadmap, at least 300 megawatts ("MW") of additional DC capacity will 
be provided, with the possibility of achieving additional capacity through the use of green energy. The 
possible 300-and-more MW is expected to significantly add to the existing 1.4 gigawatts of computing 
capacity in Singapore, with an added emphasis on energy efficiency, use of green (low-carbon) energy 
and water usage targets, and an emphasis on industry partnerships as catalysts. 
 
The challenge of managing DCs' resource footprint, while a global one, is augmented within Sin...

Content: On 30 May 2024, as part of Singapore’s Green Data Centre Roadmap, Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority announced that Singapore aims to add at least 300 megawatts of data centre capacity in the near term. The Singapore government previously announced a moratorium on data centre development in 2019 to evaluate how to manage the growth of data centres in a sustainable manner in line with its goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The moratorium was lifted recently in 2022. This announcement therefore represents a significant step forward in the data centre space in Singapore.

**Allocation of data centre capacity to be based on sustainability and economic value **

In allocating the new data centre capacity spaces, the IMDA will prioritise both sustainability and economic value. Senior Minister of State, Janil Puthucheary, has also mentioned at least another potential 200 megawatts of data centre capacity being unlocked for operators which deploy green energy technology. In total, this represen...

However, climate concerns meant it had to dial back on its data center ambitions with a three-year moratorium a year before the pandemic hit. Since lifting the suspension, Singapore has allocated a mere 80MW for four new data centers under the Call for Application - Pilot Data Center (DC-CFA) scheme in 2023.\n\nThe commitment to provide 300MW “in the near term” is therefore a major development, but what prompted the shift? And what is Singapore’s strategy amid surging competition from its neighbors? Crucially, under what conditions can data center operators gain access to this newly released capacity?\n\nA senior Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) spokesperson spoke to\n\n*DCD* to shed light on this development...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 7:\nTitle: Singapore 2024: Data Centre Colocation, Hyperscale Cloud ...\nURL: https://www.structureresearch.net/product/singapore-dci-report-2024-data-centre-colocation-hyperscale-cloud-interconnection/\nContent: ## Description\n\nThe Singapore data centre landscape has changed significantly over the last several years. The build moratorium implemented in 2020 put a pause on data centre development activity. In early 2022, the moratorium was lifted, but only a relatively small chunk of capacity has been permitted for development and will be undertaken by a small group of providers. The end result of the Singaporean government’s evaluation of the data centre sector was a fundamental reshaping of the market. Going forward, the infrastructure built in Singapore will be more strategic, geared around connectivity, edge and AI workloads, while being aligned closely with sustainability considerations and benefits for the Singaporean economy.\n\nWith the new regulations in place, Singapore has essentially peaked as a data centre colocation market as infrastructure is starting to move into nearby overflow markets such as Johor Bahru in Malaysia and Batam in Indonesia.

Absorption was primarily driven by hyperscale expansion and new power availability across key submarkets, particularly in Atlanta’s booming metro area.\n\n### Europe\n\nNet absorption among the top four European markets increased by 300.5 MW in Q1, down from an increase of 487.6 MW a year earlier. Demand easily outstripped new supply. Frankfurt and Paris accounted for most of the demand, both buoyed by new hyperscale and AI requirements.\n\n### Asia-Pacific\n\nAsia-Pacific leasing demand remained stable in Q1, driven primarily by enterprise colocation and cloud services adoption. Demand from the AI segment is also contributing to absorption both for training workloads and larger IT capacity deployments.
