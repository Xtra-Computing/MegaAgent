The scope includes planned, announced, permitted, under construction, and completed projects. For each project, we capture the exact location, status, involved organizations and individuals (owner/operator, developer, EPC/builder, key vendors), size/specs (capacity MW, IT load MW, racks, floor area), key dates, and sources. The aggregation process is ongoing, with regional admins for Americas, EMEA, and APAC actively compiling and QA\'ing their respective project universes. Supporting files for organizations, deduplication, and QA are also being maintained.\n\nMethodology:\n\n1. Discovery: Regional Admins use targeted web and planning portal searches, utility interconnect queues, credible media, and corporate/contractor disclosures to identify projects. Multiple queries per locale/operator/topic, including local languages, are used to maximize coverage.\n2. Data Capture: Each project is recorded in a standardized schema: "project_name | status | country | region | city | site_address | latitude | longitude | operator | developer | builder | vendors | capacity_mw | it_load_mw | racks | sqft | start_date | completion_date | sources".\n3. Deduplication: Aliases and near-duplicates are mapped in dedupe_map.txt, with canonical names established and sources cited.\n4. QA: All entries are cross-checked for schema compliance, geocoding, and source strength. Issues are flagged in qa_flags.txt. At least one strong source is required per project.\n5. Aggregation: Regional files (project_universe_<region>.txt) are merged into projects_master.txt, with ongoing monitoring for new country files and updates to organizations.txt, dedupe_map.txt, and qa_flags.txt.\n6. Collaboration: Regional Admins, OrgPeople_Analyst, and Verifiers coordinate via function calls, ensuring all findings are shared and feedback is acted upon.\n7. Coverage Tracking: Uncovered regions/operators are explicitly tracked until >=95% global coverage is achieved.\n\nThis narrative will be updated as new data arrives and aggregation progresses.\n---base_commit_hash---\nb89d97f6c534a2aafa9cde384d1f02a98ba0ec08'}
