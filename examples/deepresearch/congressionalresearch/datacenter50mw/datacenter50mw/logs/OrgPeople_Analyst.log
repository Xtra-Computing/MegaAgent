Title: Can US infrastructure keep up with the AI economy?
URL: https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/power-and-utilities/data-center-infrastructure-artificial-intelligence.html
Content: The scale of AI data centers and their commensurate power needs are growing exponentially. By 2035, Deloitte estimates that power demand from AI data centers in the United States could grow more than thirtyfold, reaching 123 gigawatts, up from 4 gigawatts in 2024 (figure 1).

1 AI data centers can require dramatically more energy per square foot than traditional data centers. For example, a five-acre data center augmenting central processing units with specialized graphics processing units might see its energy usage increase from 5 to 50 megawatts. 2

The leading AI infrastructure developers that are scaling data center networks globally are known as hyperscalers. Each of the top three hyperscalers’ largest US data centers currently draw less than 500 megawatts (MW) of power but the largest data centers they are constructing or planning to build are more than double to quadruple the capacities of completed projects. The largest of these are expected to require up to 2,000 MW—that is, 2 gigawatts (GW) (figure ...

Content: The company’s involvement has changed Khazna’s focus from “designing specifically for the cloud layer, to looking at how we can embrace the AI infrastructure requirement within the data center space,” says Alnaqbi.

In 2021, Khazna expanded through a deal between G42 and the state-owned incumbent telco Etisalat (previously the Emirates Telecommunications Group), now branded as e&.

“Etisalat was our main competition in the UAE, in terms of providing data center solutions, but a lot of telco operators, globally, divested data centers from their portfolio because it's not a core business to them. And that's exactly what happened here,” says Alnaqbi.

“We created a joint-venture partnership. G42 is the majority with 60 percent and e& is the minority with 40 percent equity,” he says. “We consolidated all their data center space under Khazna and, with that, we became the largest data center operator not only in the UAE but in the entire MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region from a capacity perspective.”

And that's exactly what happened here,” says Alnaqbi.\n\n“We created a joint-venture partnership. G42 is the majority with 60 percent and e& is the minority with 40 percent equity,” he says. “We consolidated all their data center space under Khazna and, with that, we became the largest data center operator not only in the UAE but in the entire MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region from a capacity perspective.”\n\nThat...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 5:\nTitle: Interview with Hassan Alnaqbi, Chief Executive Officer, Khazna Data Centers\nURL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5p4H3RDMOA\nContent: ## Economy Middle East\n##### Oct 16, 2024 (0:06:30)\nIn an interview with Economy Middle East, at GITEX GLOBAL 2024, Hassan Alnaqbi, CEO of Khazna Data Centers, announces the launch of a 100-megawatt AI-ready data center, set to be the largest in the company's portfolio by next year, featuring advanced liquid-to-liquid cooling technology for AI infrastructure.\n\nAlnaqbi highlights Khazna's role in advancing AI innovation in the UAE by supporting digital transformation and providing state-of-the-art data centers. \nAddressing energy concerns, he mentions that Khazna’s facilities are LEED Gold certified, zero-waste certified, and use biofuel instead of diesel. \n\nHe also emphasizes Khazna's competitive advantage through its investment in talent and its affiliation with G42, which gives access to cutting-edge AI advancements and global partnerships, setting it apart from\xa0competitors.\n\nFor more insights, watch the full interview.\n\n#GitexGlobal #uae #datacenter #ai #technology... {ts:0} Hassan alak CEO of kazna thank ...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}

Content: # A new data center in Latin America

Every time someone runs a query on Search, watches a video on YouTube, looks up directions on Google Maps, or uses Gmail for work or school, there's a data center behind the scenes making it all possible. We live in an era in which digital communication and access to information are foundational to the growth and development of countries and the people who live in them. That’s why we opened a data center in Chile in 2015 — to improve the connectivity of our users and the performance of our services. Today, after dedicated planning and analysis, we are taking another step forward with the construction of a second data center in Latin America, this time in Canelones, Uruguay.

We’re investing more than $850 million USD in the new data center, which will bring greater connectivity across the region, help boost the development of governments, businesses and communities — while improving access to the growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI).

The company has now applied for the environmental permits necessary for the development and has confirmed that construction will go ahead on its second Latin America data center.

Google acquired 30 hectares in the Parque de las Ciencias free trade zone in Uruguay for development in May 2021 after first announcing plans in 2020.

Little movement had been made on the project until recently, when the company presented the Environmental Impact Study and Project Document in order to obtain the Preliminary Environmental Authorization (AAP).

Current plans suggest construction will begin in March 2024.

“For Uruguay, it is an excellent sign, in the sense of the advance of innovation, technology, and the digital economy,” said the Secretary of the Presidency, Álvaro Delgado

URL: https://developingtelecoms.com/telecom-technology/data-centres-networks/17075-google-gets-go-ahead-for-uruguay-data-centre-after-water-worries.html
Content: Google’s application for its Teros data centre project in the Parque de las Ciencias free trade zone in the Canelones department in the south of Uruguay has now been approved by the country’s Environment Ministry.

This ministry’s involvement is an important factor, given the reasons for delays to the project, for which Google first acquired 30 hectares in May 2021, after announcing plans in 2020.

In November last year, Google confirmed it would be going ahead with amended plans for the data centre development.

The reason for the amended plans involve environmental concerns. As the Data Centre Dynamics website notes, the first set of development plans raised concerns about water use. The project was initially expected to use up to 7.6 million litres of potable water every day, not a good look in a country that has been through a drought since 2018 – one that reached crisis proportions in July 2023.

Content: Los Angeles-based startup X8 Cloud Infrastructure has announced plans to build an artificial intelligence and cloud services data center complex in Paraguay, leveraging hydroelectric power. They signed an agreement with Paraguay's National Electricity Administration (Ande), represented by Felix Sosa, president of Ande, to develop what is described as "the largest AI infrastructure in Latin America."

X8 Cloud seeks to "reinvent the way in which data centers can operate in a sustainable way," said Juan Carlos Dueñas, founder and CEO of the multinational, while affirming that the project will offer Brazilian companies "AI infrastructure under US jurisdiction, with Brazilian data protection rules and transparent governance, as well as significantly lower costs in training and language model inference."

According to the company, commercial operations are scheduled to start in early 2026 with an initial capacity of 50MW, which will be expanded to 500MW in 2027.

Content: X8 Cloud has partnered with Paraguay's National Electricity Administration (ANDE) to create the largest AI infrastructure in Latin America. This landmark agreement will provide countries in the region with access to world-class AI computing at 70% cost savings, operating exclusively with renewable hydroelectric power from Itaipú.

"Recent developments between the U.S. government and Paraguay have converged to make this the largest AI project in Latin America," said Damian Merlo, Government Relations at X8 Cloud.

For Félix Sosa, president of ANDE, the agreement with X8 Cloud "reflects how our renewable resources can drive technological innovation and attract strategic investments that benefit our entire region, especially strengthening our historic partnership with Brazil in the energy sector." U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio highlighted the ability of countries with abundant energy supplies to meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure.

X8 Cloud set a bold target: "My goal is to reach 5GW of AI." The plan centers on a mega campus in Paraguay, backed by abundant hydroelectric energy and room to scale. Here's what that means for engineers and dev teams who build, deploy, and run AI at production scale.

### What does "5GW of AI" signal?

It points to an AI footprint with several multi-hundred-MW sites or a cluster of very large campuses. Think tens of thousands of high-density racks, industrial-grade energy delivery, and thermal systems built for sustained AI training and inference.

The real unlock is not a single site. It's a grid-level strategy for electrical load, cooling, network transit, and hardware supply that can be repeated.

Content: # AI Data Centre Firm Nscale Plans GPU Network Expansion

The race to build infrastructure for AI is intensifying as technology companies compete for access to graphics processing units (GPUs) and data centre capacity. The global shortage of these computing resources has created opportunities for new entrants in the market – particularly those able to combine data centre operations with GPU deployment and cloud services.

Against this backdrop, Nscale, a vertically-integrated AI infrastructure provider that develops and operates data centres and GPU clusters, has secured US$155m in Series A funding to expand its operations across Europe and North America. The funding round was led by Sandton Capital Partners, with participation from Kestrel, Bluesky Asset Management and Florence Capital.

Content: ### AI data center builder Nscale nabs $155M investment

Nscale Ltd., a London startup that builds data centers optimized for artificial intelligence workloads, has raised $155 million to grow its infrastructure footprint.

The Series A round was announced this morning. Sandton Capital Partners led the investment with participation from Kestrel 0x1, Blue Sky Capital Managers and Florence Capital.

The funding milestone comes a few weeks after an AI cluster built by Nscale made it into the Top500 ranking of the world’s most powerful supercomputers. The Svartisen Cluster nabbed the 156th spot with 12.38 petaflops of maximum performance and 66,528 cores.

Nscale assembled the system from servers that each include six Advanced Micro Devices Inc. chips: two central processing units and four MI250X machine learning accelerators. The MI250X includes two graphics cards based on a six-nanometer process, as well as 128 gigabytes of onboard RAM for storing AI models’ data.
