Title: Equinix announces its highly sustainable SG6 data center
URL: https://w.media/equinix-announces-its-highly-sustainable-sg6-data-center/
Content: Equinix today announced its sixth data center in Singapore, which will be built with an initial investment of USD260 million. This new facility, set to open in Q1 2027, will offer 20MW of power upon completion. Equinix says SG6 will be covered by renewable energy and feature liquid cooling capabilities to support compute-intensive workloads, including AI.

The 9-story SG6 will be located at Jalan Tukang, just across the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) from SG5 at Tanjong Kling – formerly known as the Singapore Data Centre Park. Alongside the nearby brownfield SG2 data center further down the expressway, Equinix will have a cluster of three data centers in close proximity.

**Designed for sustainability**

SG6 was awarded as part of Singapore’s pilot Data Centre -Call for Application (DC-CFA), created to promote the development of sustainable data centers. The DC-CFA marked the end of Singapore’s three-year moratorium, which quietly began in 2019. It was watched with great interest, as the industry sought to under...

Content: The new facility follows Equinix's previously announced planned market entry into the Philippines in July and Thailand in October. SG6 will feature both environmental and operational efficiencies, enabling customers and the country to achieve goals related to their digital evolution while supporting sustainability commitments, including those associated with the Green Plan 2030, a comprehensive national strategy in Singapore to achieve sustainable development, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance environmental resilience by 2030.

Expected to open in Q1 2027, the 9-story facility was awarded as part of Singapore's pilot Data Centre - Call for Application ("DC-CFA") and will provide 20MW when fully built. With an initial investment of US$260 million, SG6 will integrate into Equinix's global network of 268 interconnected data centers (59 in Asia-Pacific) across 73 metros and 34 countries, delivering customers capacity, global reach, and seamless integration with additional interconnection and colocation service...

Title: AirTrunk reveals plans for 70MW Singapore data centre
URL: https://www.techstories.co/airtrunk-reveals-plans-for-70mw-singapore-data-centre/
Content: In an announcement made this morning, AirTrunk confirmed it is building a 70MW data centre in Singapore. AirTrunk SGP2 is the most significant data centre since the 2019 moratorium.

Indeed, it's the third biggest data centre in the island nation, backed by the largest green loan ever secured for a data centre here. How did AirTrunk secure the needed approvals for such a massive facility? Here's what we know.

## Top three in capacity

Just how big is AirTrunk's SGP2 data centre? When you stack it against other major facilities based on official announcements, it sits comfortably near the top of the list. This is notable given Singapore is a mature data centre hub.

Meta leads with its 150MW facility, followed by AirTrunk's own SGP1 at 78MW. The new SGP2 facility slots in third at 70MW, ahead of Nxera's DC Tuas at 58MW and Digital Realty's SIN12 at 50MW. This is only a guess, as some operators like Google don't divulge capacity figures; Google's fourth data centre in Singapore is physically imposing, suggesti...

The deal is Singapore’s largest-ever loan (and green loan) for a data centre project.\n\nThe transaction supports the development of sustainable digital infrastructure and reinforces Singapore’s position as a major green finance hub in Asia. The loan aligns with the Technical Screening Criteria of the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, as well as AirTrunk’s Green Financing Framework.\n\nCrédit Agricole CIB, DBS Bank, and ING Bank acted as global coordinators and sustainability structuring agents for the financing, working alongside a consortium of 23 other financial institutions.\n\nMUFG Bank, Natixis CIB, Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore), and United Overseas Bank were among the mandated lead arrangers.\n\nThe financing begins as a green loan, with the option to transition into a sustainability-linked loan (SLL).

AirTrunk SGP2 is the most significant data centre since the 2019 moratorium.\n\nIndeed, it's the third biggest data centre in the island nation, backed by the largest green loan ever secured for a data centre here. How did AirTrunk secure the needed approvals for such a massive facility? Here's what we know.\n\n## Top three in capacity\n\nJust how big is AirTrunk's SGP2 data centre? When you stack it against other major facilities based on official announcements, it sits comfortably near the top of the list. This is notable given Singapore is a mature data centre hub.\n\nMeta leads with its 150MW facility, followed by AirTrunk's own SGP1 at 78MW. The new SGP2 facility slots in third at 70MW, ahead of Nxera's DC Tuas at 58MW and Digital Realty's SIN12 at 50MW.
