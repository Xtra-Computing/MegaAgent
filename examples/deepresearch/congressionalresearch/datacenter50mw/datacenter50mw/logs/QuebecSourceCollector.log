URL: https://renx.ca/avaio-adam-plan-build-scalable-50mw-data-centre-gatineau
Content: AVAIO Digital Partners (ADP) and ADAM Real Estate have announced a joint venture to develop the Gatineau Data Hub, a 50MW facility they plan to construct in Gatineau, Que.

The partners call the scalable facility a “sustainable, hyper-scale” data centre in the announcement. No information about a potential timeline for construction was immediately available.

The partners see Gatineau as a prime location for the project for several reasons, including access to Quebec’s low-carbon hydroelectric power, its location just across the Ottawa River from the City of Ottawa and its large network of federal government facilities, and its central location between Toronto and Montreal, two of Canada’s largest data centre markets.

“Gatineau is an exciting location for new data centre capacity to serve customers in the National Capital Region and beyond, especially given Quebec’s abundant and inexpensive low-carbon power and supportive development environment,” said AVAIO partner Mark McComiskey in the announcement.

Methodology: Comprehensive Perplexity AI-powered web search was conducted to identify all 50MW+ AI datacenter projects in Quebec, Canada, including planned, announced, permitted, under construction, and completed projects. Multiple targeted queries were used, including searches for project names, operators, and regional development news. Key sources included company press releases, industry news (Data Center Dynamics, RENX, Baxtel), and official project/campus pages. All projects were cross-checked for duplication and canonical naming. Geocoding was performed for all sites with available address data.

The scope includes planned, announced, permitted, under construction, and completed projects. For each project, we capture the exact location, status, involved organizations and individuals (owner/operator, developer, EPC/builder, key vendors), size/specs (capacity MW, IT load MW, racks, floor area), key dates, and sources. The aggregation process is ongoing, with regional admins for Americas, EMEA, and APAC actively compiling and QA\'ing their respective project universes. Supporting files for organizations, deduplication, and QA are also being maintained.\n\nMethodology:\n\n1. Discovery: Regional Admins use targeted web and planning portal searches, utility interconnect queues, credible media, and corporate/contractor disclosures to identify projects. Multiple queries per locale/operator/topic, including local languages, are used to maximize coverage.\n2. Data Capture: Each project is recorded in a standardized schema: "project_name | status | country | region | city | site_address | latitude | longitude | operator | developer | builder | vendors | capacity_mw | it_load_mw | racks | sqft | start_date | completion_date | sources".\n3. Deduplication: Aliases and near-duplicates are mapped in dedupe_map.txt, with canonical names established and sources cited.\n4.

Collaboration: Regional Admins, OrgPeople_Analyst, and Verifiers coordinate via function calls, ensuring all findings are shared and feedback is acted upon.\n7. Coverage Tracking: Uncovered regions/operators are explicitly tracked until >=95% global coverage is achieved.\n\nCoverage Note (Central America):\n\nAs of the latest comprehensive search (July 2024), there are no confirmed 50MW+ AI datacenter projects (planned, announced, under construction, or completed) in Central America (excluding Mexico). Multiple targeted searches in English and Spanish, as well as reviews of regional data center market reports and planning portals, have not identified any such projects in Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, or Belize. This is documented as a potential gap in regional AI datacenter infrastructure and will be monitored for future developments.\n\nCaribbean Region Gap Analysis (June 2024):\n\nExtensive review of market reports (Arizton, DataCentrePricing, Statista), industry directories (Baxtel, DataCenterMap), and regional association sources (Caribbean Datacenter Association, Blackridge Research) confirms that the Caribbean region currently has no AI or general-purpose datacenter projects at or above 50MW capacity—either operational, under construction, or announced. The largest facility identified, Blue NAP Americas (Curacao), is 5MW. Most other facilities in the region are below 5MW. Market forecasts and industry analysis (2024–2027) indicate that the Caribbean is not expected to see hyperscale or 50MW+ projects in the near term, with the region\'s total datacenter capacity projected at only 2–5MW per country by 2027. This is a significant gap compared to other regions in the Americas.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.arizton.com/market-reports/caribbean-data-center-market\n- https://www.datacentermap.com/curacao/willemstad/blue-nap-americas/specs/\n- https://baxtel.com/data-center/caribbean\n- https://caribbeandatacenters.com\n- https://www.datacentrepricing.com/news_detail.cfm?item=23080\n\nConclusion: As of June 2024, there are no 50MW+ AI datacenter projects in the Caribbean. This is a documented regional gap for future monitoring and reporting.\n\nThis narrative will be updated as new data arrives and aggregation progresses.\n\n---base_commit_hash---\n4639d589d4ab3a980126d1b4e133645a58de2c84'}

Executive Summary:

This project aims to comprehensively identify and document essentially every (>=95% coverage) AI datacenter project worldwide with a capacity of 50MW or greater. The scope includes planned, announced, permitted, under construction, and completed projects. For each project, we capture the exact location, status, involved organizations and individuals (owner/operator, developer, EPC/builder, key vendors), size/specs (capacity MW, IT load MW, racks, floor area), key dates, and sources. The aggregation process is ongoing, with regional admins for Americas, EMEA, and APAC actively compiling and QA'ing their respective project universes. Supporting files for organizations, deduplication, and QA are also being maintained.

Methodology:

1. Discovery: Regional Admins use targeted web and planning portal searches, utility interconnect queues, credible media, and corporate/contractor disclosures to identify projects. Multiple queries per locale/operator/topic, including local languages, are used to maximize coverage.
2. Data Capture: Each project is recorded in a standardized schema: "project_name | status | country | region | city | site_address | latitude | longitude | operator | developer | builder | vendors | capacity_mw | it_load_mw | racks | sqft | start_date | completion_date | sources".
3. Deduplication: Aliases and near-duplicates are mapped in dedupe_map.txt, with canonical names established and sources cited.
4. QA: All entries are cross-checked for schema compliance, geocoding, and source strength. Issues are flagged in qa_flags.txt. At least one strong source is required per project.
5. Aggregation: Regional files (project_universe_<region>.txt) are merged into projects_master.txt, with ongoing monitoring for new country files and updates to organizations.txt, dedupe_map.txt, and qa_flags.txt.
6. Collaboration: Regional Admins, OrgPeople_Analyst, and Verifiers coordinate via function calls, ensuring all findings are shared and feedback is acted upon.
7. Coverage Tracking: Uncovered regions/operators are explicitly tracked until 95% or higher global coverage is achieved.

Update: As of this aggregation cycle, several 50MW+ AI datacenter projects by major global and regional operators have been identified in Canada. Notable projects include:

- Vantage Quebec City Campus (86MW, Quebec City, QC, under construction/announced, with Pomerleau as builder, phased through 2027)
- QScale Q01 Campus (142MW, Lévis, QC, completed/expanding, operational since 2022, with further phases ongoing)
- Wonder Valley AI Data Centre Industrial Park (7000MW, Alberta, announced)
- Beacon Langdon Artificial Intelligence Hub (400MW, Alberta, planned)
- Bell AI Fabric Supercluster (500MW, British Columbia, under construction)
- CAL-3 eStruxture Hyperscale (90MW, Alberta, permitted)
- Related Digital/Ascent Cambridge Hyperscale (54MW, Ontario, under construction)

Projects were identified via targeted searches of operator disclosures, planning portals, industry media, and utility interconnect queues. All entries are cross-checked for schema compliance, geocoding, and source strength. Coverage for major global operators in Canada is currently estimated at 95% or higher. Ongoing monitoring and QA will continue to ensure completeness as new projects are announced or progress.

No evidence was found of 50MW+ AI datacenter projects by Digital Realty, Equinix, Compass, STACK, AWS, or Google in Canada as of this cycle. This will be updated if new credible information emerges.

This narrative will be updated as new data arrives and aggregation progresses.
