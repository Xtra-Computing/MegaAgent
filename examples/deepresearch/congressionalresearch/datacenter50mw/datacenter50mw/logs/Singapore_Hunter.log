Title: Singapore lays the groundwork for smart data center growth

Content: In a move that stunned industry observers, Singapore announced on May 30 that it would release more data center capacity to the tune of 300MW, a substantial figure and a new policy direction for the nation-state.

Singapore had long held the position of a data center hub in Southeast Asia. However, climate concerns meant it had to dial back on its data center ambitions with a three-year moratorium a year before the pandemic hit. Since lifting the suspension, Singapore has allocated a mere 80MW for four new data centers under the Call for Application - Pilot Data Center (DC-CFA) scheme in 2023.

The commitment to provide 300MW “in the near term” is therefore a major development, but what prompted the shift? And what is Singapore’s strategy amid surging competition from its neighbors? Crucially, under what conditions can data center operators gain access to this newly released capacity?

Content: The demand for artificial intelligence-driven applications, cloud services, and big data analytics is rapidly increasing across Asia, with several major hyperscalers in the region expanding their digital infrastructure footprints. Although hyperscalers have made substantial investments in the construction and expansion of their own digital infrastructure, such efforts have not kept pace with the accelerating demand for capacity. Consequently, hyperscalers continue to depend heavily on third-party developers and operators, frequently engaging in the development of “build-to-suit” data center facilities in which the hyperscalers serve as the sole, long-term tenants and, in many cases, procuring additional capacity through colocation agreements with independent data center operators, or rights to acquire additional capacity via expansion of existing facilities.

Digital Realty is excited to announce the opening of its Digital Loyang II (SIN12) data center in April, marking the company's third and largest data center in the country.

The fibre-neutral, true-carrier data center will deliver a 50-megawatt IT load through an energy-efficient building, dubbed to be one of the most sustainable facilities in the region. The data center will also be equipped with Digital Realty's one-of-a-kind global data center platform called PlatformDIGITAL, which is designed to help businesses scale globally as their needs change.

Content: Digital Realty Trust has announced a third data center in Singapore. The 50MW facility on Loyang Drive on the northeast side of the country, should be fully operational by the third quarter of 2020.

The greenfield facility, on land acquired by DRT, will be the first Digital facility built from the ground up in Singapore. Digital Realty entered the Singapore market in 2010 with the acquisition of its Jurong East data center from a Japanese real estate firm, and added a second site in 2016, in an existing building.... ## Linked facilities

The new Digital Loyang II (SIN12) will be located down the road from Digital Loyang (SIN11) which was redeveloped from an existing paper store in 2016. Digital Realty confirmed to

*DCD* that the two data centers are just 350 meters apart, which makes it trivial to lay dark fiber between the facilities for connectivity.

Both SIN11 and SIN12 facilities are located close to the Changi North Cable landing station, a key sub-sea internet landing station for the region.

Content: Digital Realty Trust has announced a third data center in Singapore. The 50MW facility on Loyang Drive on the northeast side of the country, should be fully operational by the third quarter of 2020.

The greenfield facility, on land acquired by DRT, will be the first Digital facility built from the ground up in Singapore. Digital Realty entered the Singapore market in 2010 with the acquisition of its Jurong East data center from a Japanese real estate firm, and added a second site in 2016, in an existing building.... ## Linked facilities

The new Digital Loyang II (SIN12) will be located down the road from Digital Loyang (SIN11) which was redeveloped from an existing paper store in 2016. Digital Realty confirmed to

*DCD* that the two data centers are just 350 meters apart, which makes it trivial to lay dark fiber between the facilities for connectivity.

Both SIN11 and SIN12 facilities are located close to the Changi North Cable landing station, a key sub-sea internet landing station for the region.

Content: Digital Loyang 2 (SIN12) will be capable of provisioning up to 50 megawatts of critical power capacity. Located less than 25 kilometres from Singapore's central business district, the new facility will be built on a site that will span a Gross Floor Area of 34,000 square metres and will ultimately broaden opportunities for more international companies to expand into Singapore with their digital assets. Both the existing SIN11 and planned SIN12 facilities are strategically located close to the Changi North landing station. As announced in 2018, Digital Realty already has a relationship with Singapore Internet Exchange (SGIX) to provide local peering at Digital Realty's Singapore data centre facilities in Jurong West (SIN10) and Loyang Way (SIN11). As a result of this partnership, customers in both facilities are benefitting from greater and more cost-effective connectivity options.

Title: Rethinking data center design for Singapore
URL: https://engineering.fb.com/2019/01/14/data-center-engineering/singapore-data-center/
Content: In September, we broke ground on our new data center in Singapore, our first custom-built data center in Asia. Planning a hyperscale data center for a small island nation presented new opportunities for both design innovation and efficiency. Joining our portfolio of hyperefficient facilities, the Singapore data center was designed from the ground up with features that minimize the use of land, energy, and water.

When siting data centers, we look for locations with robust infrastructure, an excellent local talent pool, and great community partners. We found all three in Singapore and worked closely with local partners to tailor the building design to Singapore’s unique operating environment.... Singapore sits on an area of about 720 square kilometers — approximately 178,000 acres — which is smaller than the U.S. state of Rhode Island. Building and operating a hyperscale data center in a city-state that small limits the amount of land, water, and other resources that can be used. To conserve space, the Faceboo...

Content: ##### AirTrunk—backed by U.S. private equity giant Blackstone—received a AU$2.79 billion (US$1.8 billion) loan to build its second cloud computing facility in the eastern Singapore town of Loyang, doubling down on its investments in one of the data centre hubs in the Asia Pacific.

Indeed, it's the third biggest data centre in the island nation, backed by the largest green loan ever secured for a data centre here. How did AirTrunk secure the needed approvals for such a massive facility? Here's what we know.

## Top three in capacity

Just how big is AirTrunk's SGP2 data centre? When you stack it against other major facilities based on official announcements, it sits comfortably near the top of the list. This is notable given Singapore is a mature data centre hub.

Meta leads with its 150MW facility, followed by AirTrunk's own SGP1 at 78MW. The new SGP2 facility slots in third at 70MW, ahead of Nxera's DC Tuas at 58MW and Digital Realty's SIN12 at 50MW.

Title: AirTrunk reveals plans for 70MW Singapore data centre
URL: https://www.techstories.co/airtrunk-reveals-plans-for-70mw-singapore-data-centre/
Content: In an announcement made this morning, AirTrunk confirmed it is building a 70MW data centre in Singapore. AirTrunk SGP2 is the most significant data centre since the 2019 moratorium.

Indeed, it's the third biggest data centre in the island nation, backed by the largest green loan ever secured for a data centre here. How did AirTrunk secure the needed approvals for such a massive facility? Here's what we know.

## Top three in capacity

Just how big is AirTrunk's SGP2 data centre? When you stack it against other major facilities based on official announcements, it sits comfortably near the top of the list. This is notable given Singapore is a mature data centre hub.

Meta leads with its 150MW facility, followed by AirTrunk's own SGP1 at 78MW. The new SGP2 facility slots in third at 70MW, ahead of Nxera's DC Tuas at 58MW and Digital Realty's SIN12 at 50MW. This is only a guess, as some operators like Google don't divulge capacity figures; Google's fourth data centre in Singapore is physically imposing, suggesti...

Asia Pacific & Japan (APJ) hyperscale data centre specialist, AirTrunk, has secured a landmark S$2.25 billion green loan in Singapore to support the development of a new hyperscale data centre, AirTrunk SGP2.

This transaction – Singapore’s largest-ever loan and green loan for a data centre – marks a major milestone in sustainable digital infrastructure financing in the region. It reflects growing momentum in the shift toward responsible investment and accelerates Singapore’s trajectory as a world-leading green finance hub – a vision championed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).

The loan aligns with the Technical Screening Criteria of the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance and AirTrunk’s Green Financing Framework.

Content: The second and final phase of Singapore’s largest and efficient independent data centre, AirTrunk SGP1, is nearly complete, supporting the growth of its large tech customers throughout Southeast Asia.

The final phase takes SGP1’s total capacity to more than 78MW and showcases AirTrunk’s ability to deploy hyperscale capacity at unprecedented speed and scale – delivering ahead of schedule, and safely, the company said in a LinkedIn post.

SGP1 is a leader in sustainability and resource efficiency, ensuring AirTrunk is contributing towards Singapore’s economic and strategic objectives. Since we announced the SGP1 development in early 2019, we have completed the construction of the entire campus (in less than three years), bringing significant investment, job creation and innovation to the Singapore economy, the post added.

SGP1, along with the rest of AirTrunk’s hyperscale data centre platform, offers over 1 GW of capacity to support APAC’s digital future. Recently, AirTrunk announced the conversion of its exi...
