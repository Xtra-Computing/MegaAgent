Content: Digital Realty Trust has announced a third data center in Singapore. The 50MW facility on Loyang Drive on the northeast side of the country, should be fully operational by the third quarter of 2020.

The greenfield facility, on land acquired by DRT, will be the first Digital facility built from the ground up in Singapore. Digital Realty entered the Singapore market in 2010 with the acquisition of its Jurong East data center from a Japanese real estate firm, and added a second site in 2016, in an existing building.... ## Linked facilities

The new Digital Loyang II (SIN12) will be located down the road from Digital Loyang (SIN11) which was redeveloped from an existing paper store in 2016. Digital Realty confirmed to

*DCD* that the two data centers are just 350 meters apart, which makes it trivial to lay dark fiber between the facilities for connectivity.

Both SIN11 and SIN12 facilities are located close to the Changi North Cable landing station, a key sub-sea internet landing station for the region.

Content: Equinix today announced its sixth data center in Singapore, which will be built with an initial investment of USD260 million. This new facility, set to open in Q1 2027, will offer 20MW of power upon completion. Equinix says SG6 will be covered by renewable energy and feature liquid cooling capabilities to support compute-intensive workloads, including AI.

The 9-story SG6 will be located at Jalan Tukang, just across the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) from SG5 at Tanjong Kling – formerly known as the Singapore Data Centre Park. Alongside the nearby brownfield SG2 data center further down the expressway, Equinix will have a cluster of three data centers in close proximity.

**Designed for sustainability**

SG6 was awarded as part of Singapore’s pilot Data Centre -Call for Application (DC-CFA), created to promote the development of sustainable data centers. The DC-CFA marked the end of Singapore’s three-year moratorium, which quietly began in 2019. It was watched with great interest, as the industry sought to under...

Content: In September, we broke ground on our new data center in Singapore, our first custom-built data center in Asia. Planning a hyperscale data center for a small island nation presented new opportunities for both design innovation and efficiency. Joining our portfolio of hyperefficient facilities, the Singapore data center was designed from the ground up with features that minimize the use of land, energy, and water.

When siting data centers, we look for locations with robust infrastructure, an excellent local talent pool, and great community partners. We found all three in Singapore and worked closely with local partners to tailor the building design to Singapore’s unique operating environment.... Singapore sits on an area of about 720 square kilometers — approximately 178,000 acres — which is smaller than the U.S. state of Rhode Island. Building and operating a hyperscale data center in a city-state that small limits the amount of land, water, and other resources that can be used. To conserve space, the Faceboo...

Content: Facebook has announced its first purpose-built data center in Asia. The $1 billion ( SG$1.4bn) facility will be 11 floors tall and include the company’s new StatePoint Liquid Cooling system for a projected annual Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.19.

The new multi-story facility will offer 170,000 sq m (1.8m sq ft) of space and use 150MW of power when fully operational, making it the tallest data center in Southeast, and the largest single data center in Singapore. Facebook says it chose Singapore because of its role as a regional hub, with plenty of talent and fiber connectivity available.... This is the first Facebook data center to use StatePoint liquid cooling (developed by Facebook and Nortek, and described here), to minimize water and power consumption, with peak water used reduced by 20 percent even in Singapore’s tropical climate. The building façade will be made of a perforated lightweight material which allows air flow to the mechanical equipment inside

Planning a hyperscale data center for a small island nation presented new opportunities for both design innovation and efficiency. Joining our portfolio of hyperefficient facilities, the Singapore data center was designed from the ground up with features that minimize the use of land, energy, and water.\n\nWhen siting data centers, we look for locations with robust infrastructure, an excellent local talent pool, and great community partners. We found all three in Singapore and worked closely with local partners to tailor the building design to Singapore’s unique operating environment.... Singapore sits on an area of about 720 square kilometers — approximately 178,000 acres — which is smaller than the U.S. state of Rhode Island. Building and operating a hyperscale data center in a city-state that small limits the amount of land, water, and other resources that can be used. To conserve space, the Faceboo...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 4:\nTitle: Singapore\nURL: https://engineering.fb.com/2019/01/14/data-center-engineering/singapore-data-center/attachment/singapore-2/\nContent: Meta believes in building community through open source technology.

Title: Equinix breaks ground on 20MW data center in Singapore
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/equinix-breaks-ground-on-20mw-data-center-in-singapore/
Content: Equinix has broken ground on a new data center in Singapore. It is one of the first facilities given the green light as part of a relaxation of a years-long moratorium on new data center capacity in the city-state.

The company this week announced its sixth International Business Exchange (IBX) facility in Singapore, to be named SG6.

Expected to open in Q1 2027, the 9-story facility will offer 20MW.

With an initial investment of $260 million, the facility will provide liquid cooling capabilities to support high-density workloads.

Yee May Leong, managing director, Singapore, Equinix, said: “SG6 sets a new benchmark in our approach to driving digital and AI transformation. As compute-intensive workloads continue to grow, the demand for capacity will also rise, and Equinix is equipped to support these next-generation workloads."

Content: Equinix has begun constructing its sixth data centre in Singapore, with the US giant planning to invest $260 million in the International Business Exchange co-location facility.

Dubbed SG6, the nine-storey data centre is expected to open in the first quarter of 2027 and will provide 20 megawatts of IT capacity when fully built, Equinix said Tuesday in a release.

The project was awarded by Singapore authorities last year as part of a pilot programme after the city-state lifted its four-year moratorium on new data centre builds. SG6 will be powered by renewable energy and feature liquid cooling capability to support intensive workloads, including AI-related activity, according to Silicon Valley-based Equinix.

“By integrating the latest sustainability innovations, our new AI-ready data centre enables businesses to establish their digital infrastructure both responsibly and sustainably,” said Equinix Singapore managing director Yee May Leong.

Content: Equinix has broken ground on a new data center in Singapore. It is one of the first facilities given the green light as part of a relaxation of a years-long moratorium on new data center capacity in the city-state.

The company this week announced its sixth International Business Exchange (IBX) facility in Singapore, to be named SG6.

Expected to open in Q1 2027, the 9-story facility will offer 20MW.

With an initial investment of $260 million, the facility will provide liquid cooling capabilities to support high-density workloads.

Yee May Leong, managing director, Singapore, Equinix, said: “SG6 sets a new benchmark in our approach to driving digital and AI transformation. As compute-intensive workloads continue to grow, the demand for capacity will also rise, and Equinix is equipped to support these next-generation workloads."

Equinix noted the new facility's capacity was part of that awarded last year under Singapore's pilot Data Center - Call for Application scheme.
