Content: ## Early life and education (1942–1967)

McConnell was born on February 20, 1942, to Julia Odene "Dean" (née Shockley) and Addison Mitchell "A.M." McConnell II at Colbert County Hospital (now Helen Keller Hospital) in Sheffield, Alabama, and grew up in Athens, Alabama, where his grandfather, Robert Hayes McConnell Sr., and his great-uncle, Addison Mitchell McConnell, owned McConnell Funeral Home. He is of Scots-Irish and English descent. His ancestor James McConnell fought on the American side in the American Revolutionary War.

In 1944, at the age of two, McConnell's upper left leg was paralyzed by a polio attack. He and his mother were living with an aunt in Five Points, Alabama, at the time, and he received treatment at the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation. The treatment potentially saved him from being disabled for the rest of his life. McConnell said his family "almost went broke" because of costs related to his illness.

Menendez rose steadily through the world of New Jersey politics to fulfill his 
childhood dream of becoming a United States Senator. “I have walked in the

Content: ## Rooted In Oregon

Jeff is Oregon’s “roots and boots” Senator—called that because of his deep Oregon roots and his boots on the ground, traveling to meet with Oregonians in every corner of the state.

Born in the Southern Oregon timber town of Myrtle Creek, Jeff spent his early years in Douglas County, where his father worked as a millwright—the mechanic who keeps the mill machinery running. The family moved with the timber economy to Roseburg, and then to East Multnomah County.

Jeff’s parents personally experienced the great American expansion of the middle class in the post-World War II era. Though they both came from humble origins, Jeff’s parents were able to save enough money to buy a modest home, take their children on yearly camping trips, and retire comfortably after a lifetime of contributing to their community.

They also instilled in him from an early age the value of education. When Jeff was young, his father took him to the doors of his school and told him, “If you walk through those doors and...

Content: ## Early Days

## A "mom in tennis shoes"

As a working mom, Patty was never planning to enter politics. But when she saw problems in her community, she realized she couldn’t just wait for someone else to solve them. When local officials planned to close her kids’ preschool program due to state budget cuts, Patty took action. She packed up her two young children and went to Olympia to urge her state representatives to save the preschool program. While there, one male legislator told her she couldn’t make a difference because she was “just a mom in tennis shoes.” Patty didn’t let that stop her—in response, she organized a grassroots coalition of 13,000 parents that fought successfully to save the preschool program.

Patty saw the difference local government could make if it was more like the people and families it represents, which led her to serve on the Shoreline School Board, and in 1988, she was elected to the Washington State Senate.

In 1991, Patty watched the Anita Hill hearings along with the rest of t...

Content: Patty was born and raised in Bothell, Washington where she grew up with her parents and six 
siblings—including a twin sister. Her father managed a Main Street 5 and 10 cent store, where 
she worked growing up and first learned the value of strong work ethic. When Patty was a young 
teenager, her father—a World War II veteran and Purple Heart recipient—was diagnosed with 
Multiple Sclerosis and in a few short years, his illness got so bad he could no longer work. 
Patty’s mother, who had stayed home to raise their family, had to take care of him while also 
working to support their family. She found some work, but it didn’t pay enough to support Patty 
and her six brothers and sisters—and a husband with growing medical bills. Thankfully, they

After failing four classes his freshman year of high school, Tim’s path forward was murky at best.

But thankfully, he had a mom who stuck with him, and met a mentor that showed him the wisdom of conservative principles. Through their belief and his own determination, Tim got his grades back on track, graduated from Charleston Southern University, and eventually built his own successful small business.

Through the lessons taught by his mentor, Tim developed his mission statement: to positively affect the lives of a billion people.

Sinema was born in Tucson, Arizona, on July 12, 1976, to Marilyn (Wiley) and Dan Sinema. Sinema has an older brother and younger sister. Her father was an attorney. Her parents divorced when she was a child, and her mother, who had custody of the children, remarried. With her siblings, mother, and stepfather, Sinema moved to DeFuniak Springs, Florida, a small town on the Panhandle.

### Poverty and contradictions with family

Sinema has said that when her stepfather lost his job and the bank foreclosed on their home, the family lived for three years in an abandoned gas station and that for two years they had no toilet or electricity while living there. She later recalled: "My stepdad built a bunkbed for me and my sister. We separated our bunkbed from the kitchen with one of those big chalkboards on rollers. I knew that was weird. A chalkboard shouldn't be a wall. A kitchen should have running water."

Warren was born Elizabeth Ann Herring in Oklahoma City on June 22, 1949. She is the fourth child of Pauline Louise (née Reed, 1912–1995), a homemaker, and Donald Jones Herring (1911–1997), a U.S. Army flight instructor during World War II, both of whom were members of the evangelical branch of the Protestant Methodist Church. Warren has described her early family life as teetering "on the ragged edge of the middle class" and "kind of hanging on at the edges by our fingernails." She and her three older brothers were raised Methodist.

Warren lived in Norman, Oklahoma, until she was 11 years old, when her family moved back to Oklahoma City. When she was 12, her father, then a salesman at Montgomery Ward, had a heart attack, which led to many medical bills as well as a pay cut because he could not do his previous work.

McConnell was born on February 20, 1942, to Julia Odene "Dean" (née Shockley) and Addison Mitchell "A.M." McConnell II at Colbert County Hospital (now Helen Keller Hospital) in Sheffield, Alabama, and grew up in Athens, Alabama, where his grandfather, Robert Hayes McConnell Sr., and his great-uncle, Addison Mitchell McConnell, owned McConnell Funeral Home. He is of Scots-Irish and English descent. His ancestor James McConnell fought on the American side in the American Revolutionary War.

The treatment potentially saved him from being disabled for the rest of his life. McConnell said his family "almost went broke" because of costs related to his illness.

Content: ## Rooted In Oregon

Jeff is Oregon’s “roots and boots” Senator—called that because of his deep Oregon roots and his boots on the ground, traveling to meet with Oregonians in every corner of the state.

Born in the Southern Oregon timber town of Myrtle Creek, Jeff spent his early years in Douglas County, where his father worked as a millwright—the mechanic who keeps the mill machinery running. The family moved with the timber economy to Roseburg, and then to East Multnomah County.

Jeff’s parents personally experienced the great American expansion of the middle class in the post-World War II era. Though they both came from humble origins, Jeff’s parents were able to save enough money to buy a modest home, take their children on yearly camping trips, and retire comfortably after a lifetime of contributing to their community.

They also instilled in him from an early age the value of education. When Jeff was young, his father took him to the doors of his school and told him, “If you walk through those doors and...

As a working mom, Patty was never planning to enter politics. But when she saw problems in her community, she realized she couldn’t just wait for someone else to solve them. When local officials planned to close her kids’ preschool program due to state budget cuts, Patty took action. She packed up her two young children and went to Olympia to urge her state representatives to save the preschool program. While there, one male legislator told her she couldn’t make a difference because she was “just a mom in tennis shoes.” Patty didn’t let that stop her—in response, she organized a grassroots coalition of 13,000 parents that fought successfully to save the preschool program.

Patty saw the difference local government could make if it was more like the people and families it represents, which led her to serve on the Shoreline School Board, and in 1988, she was elected to the Washington State Senate.

Content: Patty was born and raised in Bothell, Washington where she grew up with her parents and six 
siblings—including a twin sister. Her father managed a Main Street 5 and 10 cent store, where 
she worked growing up and first learned the value of strong work ethic. When Patty was a young 
teenager, her father—a World War II veteran and Purple Heart recipient—was diagnosed with 
Multiple Sclerosis and in a few short years, his illness got so bad he could no longer work. 
Patty’s mother, who had stayed home to raise their family, had to take care of him while also 
working to support their family. She found some work, but it didn’t pay enough to support Patty 
and her six brothers and sisters—and a husband with growing medical bills. Thankfully, they

Marco Antonio Rubio was born in 1971 in Miami, Florida. He is the second son and third child of Mario Rubio Reina and Oriales (née García) Rubio. His parents were Cubans who immigrated to the United States in 1956 during the regime of Fulgencio Batista, two and a half years before Fidel Castro ascended to power after the Cuban Revolution. His mother made at least four return trips to Cuba after Castro's takeover, including a month-long trip in 1961, and a return to Cuba had been planned before the changes in their native country. Rubio's parents were not U.S. citizens at the time of Rubio's birth. They were naturalized in 1975. Some relatives of Rubio's were admitted to the U.S. as refugees.

Rubio's maternal grandfather, Pedro Victor Garcia, immigrated to the U.S. legally in 1956, but returned to Cuba to find work in 1959. When in 1962 he fled communist Cuba and returned to the U.S. without a visa, he was detained as an undocumented immigrant and an immigration judge ordered him ...

In 1981, he was elected to the first of four terms as mayor of Burlington. Sanders lectured at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and at Hamilton College in upstate New York before his 1990 election as Vermont’s at-large member in Congress.

Content: Growing up in a poor, single-parent household in North Charleston, South Carolina, a young Tim Scott grew accustomed to moving every few years, as well as the long hours his mom worked to keep a roof over their heads. After failing four classes his freshman year of high school, Tim’s path forward was murky at best.

But thankfully, he had a mom who stuck with him, and met a mentor that showed him the wisdom of conservative principles. Through their belief and his own determination, Tim got his grades back on track, graduated from Charleston Southern University, and eventually built his own successful small business.

Through the lessons taught by his mentor, Tim developed his mission statement: to positively affect the lives of a billion people. That led him to public service, where he was elected to Charleston County Council, the South Carolina House of Representatives, the United States House of Representatives, and the United States Senate.

Sinema was born in Tucson, Arizona, on July 12, 1976, to Marilyn (Wiley) and Dan Sinema. Sinema has an older brother and younger sister. Her father was an attorney. Her parents divorced when she was a child, and her mother, who had custody of the children, remarried. With her siblings, mother, and stepfather, Sinema moved to DeFuniak Springs, Florida, a small town on the Panhandle.

### Poverty and contradictions with family

Sinema has said that when her stepfather lost his job and the bank foreclosed on their home, the family lived for three years in an abandoned gas station and that for two years they had no toilet or electricity while living there. She later recalled: "My stepdad built a bunkbed for me and my sister. We separated our bunkbed from the kitchen with one of those big chalkboards on rollers. I knew that was weird. A chalkboard shouldn't be a wall. A kitchen should have running water."

She later recalled: "My stepdad built a bunkbed for me and my sister. We separated our bunkbed from the kitchen with one of those big chalkboards on rollers. I knew that was weird.

To earn money for college, at age 19 she worked on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, where she was a labor union member. After college, she went to the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College where she met her husband Archie in line at the First Year BBQ. In 1984, excited by the possibility of starting their careers, Tina and Archie moved to what would become their permanent home: Minnesota.

Tester was born on August 21, 1956, in Havre, Montana, one of three sons of Helen Marie (née Pearson), who was born in North Dakota and David O. Tester, born in Utah. He is the descendant of Mormon pioneers on his father's side. His father was of English descent and his mother was of Swedish ancestry. Tester grew up in Chouteau County, near the town of Big Sandy, Montana, on land that his grandfather homesteaded in 1912.

In 1978, he graduated from the University of Providence (then called the College of Great Falls) with a B.A. in music.

He served in the North Carolina House of Representatives from 2007 to 2015 and as the State House speaker from 2011 to 2015.

Thom was born into a working-class family with his father and mother and five siblings.

Warren was born Elizabeth Ann Herring in Oklahoma City on June 22, 1949. She is the fourth child of Pauline Louise (née Reed, 1912–1995), a homemaker, and Donald Jones Herring (1911–1997), a U.S. Army flight instructor during World War II, both of whom were members of the evangelical branch of the Protestant Methodist Church. Warren has described her early family life as teetering "on the ragged edge of the middle class" and "kind of hanging on at the edges by our fingernails." She and her three older brothers were raised Methodist.

Warren lived in Norman, Oklahoma, until she was 11 years old, when her family moved back to Oklahoma City. When she was 12, her father, then a salesman at Montgomery Ward, had a heart attack, which led to many medical bills as well as a pay cut because he could not do his previous work. After leaving his sales job, he worked as a maintenance man for an apartment building. Eventually, the family's car was repossessed because they failed to make loan pa...
