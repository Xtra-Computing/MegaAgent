Republicans held the House until Democrats retook it in the 2018 elections, which became the largest shift of power to the Democrats since the 1970s.

Republicans held the House until Democrats retook it in the 2018 elections, which became the largest shift of power to the Democrats since the 1970s. In the 2022 elections, Republicans took back control of the House, winning a slim majority.\n\nFollowing the election of transgender representative Sarah McBride in November 2024, House speaker Mike Johnson announced that restrooms in the House would be restricted based on "biological sex", i.e. sex assignment at birth. The announcement was criticized as transphobic bullying; McBride announced she would comply with the rule but called it an "effort to distract from the real issues facing this country".... ## Historical composition\n\nThis chart shows the his...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 9:\nTitle: 119th United States Congress - Wikipedia\nURL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/119th_United_States_Congress\nContent: ## Leadership\n\n**Note:** Democrats refer to themselves as a "caucus"; Republicans refer to themselves as a "conference"....

Title: About Nanette - Congresswoman Barragan
URL: https://barragan.house.gov/about/
Content: Nanette Barragán was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 2016, becoming the first Latina ever to represent California’s 44th Congressional district.

Born and raised in the Harbor Gateway, Nanette’s humble beginnings shaped her interest in issues that matter locally: environmental and health justice, immigration reform, strengthening the economy and affordable and accessible education.

As the youngest of eleven children raised by immigrant parents from Mexico, Nanette knows about the challenges that many low-income minority families face firsthand. Her father, a local tv repairman, instilled in her a strong work ethic and influenced her love for baseball (in particular, for the Los Angeles Dodgers). Her mother, who only completed the third grade, cleaned homes, cared for others and worked in factories to make ends meet. Nanette learned from her parents the values of hard work, and obtained her undergraduate degree from UCLA and her Juris Doctor from USC Gould School of Law.

Content: **John Ream Curtis** (born May 10, 1960) is an American politician serving since 2025 as the junior United States senator from Utah. A member of the Republican Party, Curtis served from 2017 to 2025 as the U.S. representative for Utah's 3rd congressional district and from 2010 to 2017 as the 44th mayor of Provo.

On November 7, 2017, Curtis won a special election to replace Jason Chaffetz in the U.S. House of Representatives. He completed Chaffetz's term and was reelected three times. In the 2024 election, Curtis was elected to the U.S. Senate to succeed Mitt Romney.

Curtis is generally considered a moderate Republican. He is the founder of the Conservative Climate Caucus and was a member of the centrist Republican Governance Group. Curtis did not support Donald Trump during the 2024 Republican primaries. Given his votes for bills such as the Respect for Marriage Act, analysts have generally considered Curtis's positions as similar to Romney's, although he has rejected such characterizations.

URL: https://barragan.house.gov/about/
Content: Nanette Barragán was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 2016, becoming the first Latina ever to represent California’s 44th Congressional district.

Born and raised in the Harbor Gateway, Nanette’s humble beginnings shaped her interest in issues that matter locally: environmental and health justice, immigration reform, strengthening the economy and affordable and accessible education.

As the youngest of eleven children raised by immigrant parents from Mexico, Nanette knows about the challenges that many low-income minority families face firsthand. Her father, a local tv repairman, instilled in her a strong work ethic and influenced her love for baseball (in particular, for the Los Angeles Dodgers). Her mother, who only completed the third grade, cleaned homes, cared for others and worked in factories to make ends meet. Nanette learned from her parents the values of hard work, and obtained her undergraduate degree from UCLA and her Juris Doctor from USC Gould School of Law.

Title: Joyce Beatty | Baldwin Wallace University

Content: ### Background

Growing up in a home where civil rights were a common topic of conversation, Beatty was further inspired to get involved in politics when she watched Jesse Jackson speak at the 1984 Democratic National Convention (Barone & McCutcheon). Her husband, Otto, served in the Ohio State House of Representatives for 18 years. In 1998, after he resigned, Joyce was appointed his successor, easily holding on to the seat in the following regular election (White & Allen). In 2006, she became the first woman ever elected Minority Leader, the highest ranking Democrat in the State House.

In 2012, Ohio's controversial redistricting process created a safe Democratic seat in the Columbus area. Beatty ran against 3 other Democrats in the primary, including former US House member Mary Jo Kilroy. In a tight race, Beatty won with 38% of the vote, defeating Kilroy by only 3 points. She went on to win the general election with 72% of the vote, beating Republican Chris Long, a former city council member.

Content: **Michael Joseph Bost** (/ˈbɔːst/ *BAWST*; born December 30, 1960) is an American politician. A member of the Republican Party, he has served as the U.S. representative for Illinois's 12th congressional district since 2015. From 1995 to 2015, Bost was a member of the Illinois House of Representatives, representing the 115th district. Before holding elected office, he was a firefighter.

## Early life and career

Bost was raised Baptist and graduated from Murphysboro High School. He attended a firefighter academy program offered by the University of Illinois, later becoming a firefighter. Because the firefighter program isn't a college-level degree, he is one of two current Representatives to not have attended a college program leading to a college degree (the other being Lauren Boebert). He served in the United States Marine Corps from 1979 to 1982.

Bost ran his family's trucking business for ten years. Since 1989, he and his wife Tracy have owned and operated White House Salon in Murphysboro.

URL: https://carey.house.gov/about/
Content: Born in 1971, Mike was raised in the small town of Sabina, Ohio. On the family farm, he was instilled with values that continue to guide him today – hard work, community, and freedom. Following his graduation from East Clinton High School, he followed his family tradition of service, earning an ROTC scholarship, attending the Marion Military Institute, and serving as an officer in the military. During this time, he also earned his bachelor’s degree from the Ohio State University.

As a professional, Mike became an executive for one of the nation’s largest privately owned energy companies, headquartered in Ohio. For more than 20 years, he fought to protect American jobs by fighting back against the same radical energy policies being pushed today by the Democrats. As an advocate for coal miners and American energy independence, he also worked to save miners’ pension benefits and reverse overreaching government regulations while valuing the environment.

John was a young lawyer who recently completed his bachelor’s degree from Texas Tech and his law degree from University of Texas. At first, he was only one of two lawyers in Round Rock, Texas, but a decade later John Carter was appointed District Judge for the 277th District Court in Williamson County. During that time, he aptly earned the nickname that stuck with him to this day; Judge.

On the bench, Judge was known for his no-nonsense approach to keeping our community safe. In fact, it was this mentality that encouraged him to run for Congress in 2002.

Content: Throughout his career, Greg Stanton has worked tirelessly to deliver results for Arizona families. Serving as Phoenix mayor from 2012 to 2018, he focused on building an economy rooted in innovation and trade. Under his leadership, Phoenix created thousands of quality jobs and recently saw the highest wage growth in the nation.

Greg has earned a reputation for working across the aisle to get things done. His biggest accomplishments in Phoenix were passed with bipartisan support: the City’s investment in the biosciences and higher education, support for small businesses, and national recognition for leadership on LGBT equality. In 2015, Stanton won reelection and successfully led one of the most ambitious transportation initiatives in the country—a bipartisan, voter-backed plan to extend Phoenix’s light rail system, expand bus service, and improve thousands of miles of roadways over the next 35 years.

Content: ## Early life and education (1942–1967)

McConnell was born on February 20, 1942, to Julia Odene "Dean" (née Shockley) and Addison Mitchell "A.M." McConnell II at Colbert County Hospital (now Helen Keller Hospital) in Sheffield, Alabama, and grew up in Athens, Alabama, where his grandfather, Robert Hayes McConnell Sr., and his great-uncle, Addison Mitchell McConnell, owned McConnell Funeral Home. He is of Scots-Irish and English descent. His ancestor James McConnell fought on the American side in the American Revolutionary War.

In 1944, at the age of two, McConnell's upper left leg was paralyzed by a polio attack. He and his mother were living with an aunt in Five Points, Alabama, at the time, and he received treatment at the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation. The treatment potentially saved him from being disabled for the rest of his life. McConnell said his family "almost went broke" because of costs related to his illness.

Content: **Jeffrey Alan Merkley** (born October 24, 1956) is an American politician who is the junior United States senator from Oregon. He was first elected to the Senate in 2008. A member of the Democratic Party, he served from 1999 to 2009 as the representative for the 47th district in the Oregon House of Representatives, which covers central Multnomah County on the eastern side of Portland, Oregon; he was the speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives during the last two years of his tenure.

Jeff is Oregon’s “roots and boots” Senator—called that because of his deep Oregon roots and his boots on the ground, traveling to meet with Oregonians in every corner of the state.

Born in the Southern Oregon timber town of Myrtle Creek, Jeff spent his early years in Douglas County, where his father worked as a millwright—the mechanic who keeps the mill machinery running. The family moved with the timber economy to Roseburg, and then to East Multnomah County.

Jeff’s parents personally experienced the great American expansion of the middle class in the post-World War II era. Though they both came from humble origins, Jeff’s parents were able to save enough money to buy a modest home, take their children on yearly camping trips, and retire comfortably after a lifetime of contributing to their community.

They also instilled in him from an early age the value of education. When Jeff was young, his father took him to the doors of his school and told him, “If you walk through those doors and...

As a working mom, Patty was never planning to enter politics. But when she saw problems in her community, she realized she couldn’t just wait for someone else to solve them. When local officials planned to close her kids’ preschool program due to state budget cuts, Patty took action. She packed up her two young children and went to Olympia to urge her state representatives to save the preschool program. While there, one male legislator told her she couldn’t make a difference because she was “just a mom in tennis shoes.” Patty didn’t let that stop her—in response, she organized a grassroots coalition of 13,000 parents that fought successfully to save the preschool program.

Patty saw the difference local government could make if it was more like the people and families it represents, which led her to serve on the Shoreline School Board, and in 1988, she was elected to the Washington State Senate.

In 1991, Patty watched the Anita Hill hearings along with the rest of t...

Content: Patty was born and raised in Bothell, Washington where she grew up with her parents and six 
siblings—including a twin sister. Her father managed a Main Street 5 and 10 cent store, where 
she worked growing up and first learned the value of strong work ethic. When Patty was a young 
teenager, her father—a World War II veteran and Purple Heart recipient—was diagnosed with 
Multiple Sclerosis and in a few short years, his illness got so bad he could no longer work. 
Patty’s mother, who had stayed home to raise their family, had to take care of him while also 
working to support their family. She found some work, but it didn’t pay enough to support Patty 
and her six brothers and sisters—and a husband with growing medical bills. Thankfully, they 
lived in a country where the government didn’t just say “you’re on your own.”   
 
During this tough time, Patty’s family received some help from the VA for their father’s medical 
care, but for several months her family had to rely on food stamps. However, thanks to a ...

Content: Nanette Barragán was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 2016, becoming the first Latina ever to represent California’s 44th Congressional district.

Born and raised in the Harbor Gateway, Nanette’s humble beginnings shaped her interest in issues that matter locally: environmental and health justice, immigration reform, strengthening the economy and affordable and accessible education.

As the youngest of eleven children raised by immigrant parents from Mexico, Nanette knows about the challenges that many low-income minority families face firsthand. Her father, a local tv repairman, instilled in her a strong work ethic and influenced her love for baseball (in particular, for the Los Angeles Dodgers). Her mother, who only completed the third grade, cleaned homes, cared for others and worked in factories to make ends meet. Nanette learned from her parents the values of hard work, and obtained her undergraduate degree from UCLA and her Juris Doctor from USC Gould School of Law.

Title: Joyce Beatty | Baldwin Wallace University
URL: https://www.bw.edu/centers/women-and-politics-of-ohio/bios/11-beatty-joyce/
Content: ### Background

Growing up in a home where civil rights were a common topic of conversation, Beatty was further inspired to get involved in politics when she watched Jesse Jackson speak at the 1984 Democratic National Convention (Barone & McCutcheon). Her husband, Otto, served in the Ohio State House of Representatives for 18 years. In 1998, after he resigned, Joyce was appointed his successor, easily holding on to the seat in the following regular election (White & Allen). In 2006, she became the first woman ever elected Minority Leader, the highest ranking Democrat in the State House.

In 2012, Ohio's controversial redistricting process created a safe Democratic seat in the Columbus area. Beatty ran against 3 other Democrats in the primary, including former US House member Mary Jo Kilroy. In a tight race, Beatty won with 38% of the vote, defeating Kilroy by only 3 points. She went on to win the general election with 72% of the vote, beating Republican Chris Long, a former city council member.

Her husband, Otto, served in the Ohio State House of Representatives for 18 years. In 1998, after he resigned, Joyce was appointed his successor, easily holding on to the seat in the following regular election (White & Allen). In 2006, she became the first woman ever elected Minority Leader, the highest ranking Democrat in the State House.\n\nIn 2012, Ohio's controversial redistricting process created a safe Democratic seat in the Columbus area. Beatty ran against 3 other Democrats in the primary, including former US House member Mary Jo Kilroy. In a tight race, Beatty won with 38% of the vote, defeating Kilroy by only 3 points. She went on to win the general election with 72% of the vote, beating Republican Chris Long, a former city council member.\n\nIn the House,...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}

URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Bost
Content: **Michael Joseph Bost** (/ˈbɔːst/ *BAWST*; born December 30, 1960) is an American politician. A member of the Republican Party, he has served as the U.S. representative for Illinois's 12th congressional district since 2015. From 1995 to 2015, Bost was a member of the Illinois House of Representatives, representing the 115th district. Before holding elected office, he was a firefighter.

## Early life and career

Bost was raised Baptist and graduated from Murphysboro High School. He attended a firefighter academy program offered by the University of Illinois, later becoming a firefighter. Because the firefighter program isn't a college-level degree, he is one of two current Representatives to not have attended a college program leading to a college degree (the other being Lauren Boebert). He served in the United States Marine Corps from 1979 to 1982.

Bost ran his family's trucking business for ten years. Since 1989, he and his wife Tracy have owned and operated White House Salon in Murphysboro.

Content: Born in 1971, Mike was raised in the small town of Sabina, Ohio. On the family farm, he was instilled with values that continue to guide him today – hard work, community, and freedom. Following his graduation from East Clinton High School, he followed his family tradition of service, earning an ROTC scholarship, attending the Marion Military Institute, and serving as an officer in the military. During this time, he also earned his bachelor’s degree from the Ohio State University.

As a professional, Mike became an executive for one of the nation’s largest privately owned energy companies, headquartered in Ohio. For more than 20 years, he fought to protect American jobs by fighting back against the same radical energy policies being pushed today by the Democrats. As an advocate for coal miners and American energy independence, he also worked to save miners’ pension benefits and reverse overreaching government regulations while valuing the environment.

Rick Crawford is a Republican U.S. congressman from Arkansas who was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010 as part of the wave of new conservatives who made up the Tea Party Movement, a group whose emergence helped the Republicans regain the majority in the House. After arriving in Washington DC, Crawford began compiling a record characterized by strong opposition to President Barack Obama and equally strong support of President Donald Trump. He has also proven himself to be adept at getting votes, being easily reelected five times.

Eric Alan “Rick” Crawford was born on January 22, 1966, on Homestead Air Force Base in Florida. He was one of three sons born to Ruth Anne Crawford and Donnie J. Crawford. His father was in the U.S. Air Force, so the family moved several times, and Crawford graduated from Alvirne High School in Hudson, New Hampshire, before entering the U.S. Army.

Content: **Daniel Milton Newhouse** (born July 10, 1955) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for Washington's 4th congressional district. The district covers much of the central third of the state, including Yakima and the Tri-Cities. Before his election to Congress, Newhouse served as director of the Washington State Department of Agriculture and as a member of the Washington House of Representatives. He is a member of the Republican Party.

Newhouse was among the ten House Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump during his second impeachment. Benefiting from Washington state's blanket primary system and crowded primary, Newhouse advanced to the general election with 25.5% of the total vote, despite only garnering approximately one-third of the votes cast by Republicans. Newhouse is one of two Republicans to vote for impeachment and win renomination and reelections in 2022 and 2024, along with David Valadao of California.

Perry knows the importance of hard work and dedication.

Content: Chellie Pingree never anticipated a life in politics. Living on the offshore island of North Haven, Maine, she raised her kids and ran a small business. She served on the school board and as the local tax assessor, a job no one else in town wanted. But in 1991, when she was approached about running for State Senate, she jumped at the chance.

She scored a remarkable upset, defeating a popular Republican, and went on to serve four terms in the Maine Senate. But throughout her political career, from Augusta to Washington and beyond, the lessons she learned on North Haven have always been her guide: Be accountable to your neighbors, and always use your common sense.
