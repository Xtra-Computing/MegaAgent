Coach Tuberville was born in Camden, Arkansas on September 18, 1954, the third of three children of Olive and Charles Tuberville.

College Football's 2004 Coach of the Year and two-time SEC Coach of the Year, Tommy Tuberville is most often recognized for his success on the field. But it is the legacy of his father, a highly decorated WWII veteran and Purple Heart recipient, that motivates Coach Tuberville to give back to the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces.

Content: Tommy Tuberville (born September 18, 1954, Camden, Arkansas, U.S.) is a Republican U.S. senator from Alabama and a former high-school and college football player and coach. For some 10 months in 2023 Tuberville used his authority under the Senate 's standing rules to block hundreds of senior promotions of U.S. military officers in protest of a U.S. Defense Department policy granting leave of absence and reimbursement of travel expenses to military personnel seeking abortions or other reproductive health services.
Tuberville played football at Harmony Grove High School near his birthplace at Camden, Arkansas, and later at Southern State College (now Southern Arkansas University) in Magnolia, where he earned a bachelor's degree in physical education in 1976. He also played on the college's golf team. After graduating he coached high-school football for several years before joining the coaching staff at Arkansas State University in Jonesboro in 1980.

Ruben Gallego is the son of immigrants from Colombia and Mexico. Along with his three sisters, he was raised by a single mother in a small apartment on a secretary's salary and slept on the family’s living room floor, finally getting his own bed when he went away to college.

Growing up poor, he took any job he could find — working at a pizza joint, construction sites, and a meat-packing plant — to help support his family. He earned a spot at Harvard University, where he again worked numerous odd jobs to pay his way through school.

Ruben enlisted in the Marine Corps and deployed as an infantryman to Iraq, where his company saw some of the heaviest casualties of the war.

John Hickenlooper took an unconventional path to public office. After starting out as a geologist, John took a chance by opening the first brewpub in Colorado. As a small business owner, he gained a deep understanding of the local community and the value of collaboration. John entered public service because he knew he could listen to the diverse array of Colorado voices and get things done. As Colorado’s U.S. Senator, John is committed to bringing people together to solve our country’s toughest problems.

## Humble Beginnings

John was raised by a strong single mother after he lost his father to cancer when he was just eight years old. He remembers his father teaching him that if you can learn to laugh at something, it can never beat you. John has carried that lesson throughout his life.

Content: ## Early life and education

Marco Antonio Rubio was born in 1971 in Miami, Florida. He is the second son and third child of Mario Rubio Reina and Oriales (née García) Rubio. His parents were Cubans who immigrated to the United States in 1956 during the regime of Fulgencio Batista, two and a half years before Fidel Castro ascended to power after the Cuban Revolution. His mother made at least four return trips to Cuba after Castro's takeover, including a month-long trip in 1961, and a return to Cuba had been planned before the changes in their native country. Rubio's parents were not U.S. citizens at the time of Rubio's birth. They were naturalized in 1975. Some relatives of Rubio's were admitted to the U.S. as refugees.

Rubio's maternal grandfather, Pedro Victor Garcia, immigrated to the U.S. legally in 1956, but returned to Cuba to find work in 1959. When in 1962 he fled communist Cuba and returned to the U.S. without a visa, he was detained as an undocumented immigrant and an immigration judge ordered him ...

URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_senators_in_the_117th_Congress
Content: This is a complete list of United States senators during the 117th United States Congress listed by seniority from January 3, 2021, to January 3, 2023. It is a historical listing and will contain people who have not served the entire two-year Congress should anyone resign, die, or be expelled.

In this Congress, the most junior senior senator was Kelly Loeffler until Jon Ossoff (from the other seat) and Raphael Warnock (Loeffler's successor) were sworn in on January 20, 2021, after which Ossoff became the most junior senior senator. The most senior junior senator is Maria Cantwell.

Order of service is based on the commencement of the senator's first term. Behind this is former service as a senator (only giving the senator seniority within their new incoming class), service as vice president, a House member, a cabinet secretary, or a governor of a state. The final factors are the population of the senator's state and the alphabetical position of the senator's surname.... ## Terms of service

For senators beginning their terms on the same day, with the same previous service, representing the same state, they are ranked alphabetically by their surname.

In this Congress, Maria Cantwell is the most senior junior senator. JD Vance was the most junior senior senator in the first seven days of the Congress until his resignation on January 10, 2025, to become vice president; his fell...

It is a historical listing and will contain people who have not served the entire two-year Congress should anyone resign, die, or be expelled.\n\nOrder of service is based on the commencement of the senator's first term. Behind this is former service as a senator (only giving the senator seniority within their new incoming class), service as vice president, a House member, a cabinet secretary, or a governor of a state. The final factor is the population of the senator's state. For senators beginning their terms on the same day, with the same previous service, representing the same state, they are ranked alphabetically by their surname.\n\nIn this Congress, Maria Cantwell is the most senior junior senator.
