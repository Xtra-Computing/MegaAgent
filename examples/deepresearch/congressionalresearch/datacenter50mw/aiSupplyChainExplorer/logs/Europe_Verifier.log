According to Pitchbook, European AI companies raised over $13B in 2024 – marking a 22% increase in capital invested, even as deal volume declined by 31% year-over-year. The increase in capital, despite the drop in deal volume, signals a consolidation of funding among established frontrunners across core LLMs, generative AI application layers, AI automation and deep tech. Some of the most active European investors fueling this growth include BPI France, LocalGlobe, Balderton, Index Ventures and Atomico. All have played a significant role in backing AI-driven startups across the region.

The U.K. remains a dominant AI hub, securing nearly $6B in AI funding in 2024—more than France and Germany combined (refer to chart below). However, France is rapidly catching up with Mistral AI emerging as the region’s leading LLM provider after raising over $1B within one year of its founding.

Content: Most memory industry participants view emerging memories as the eventual path of the business: There’s no doubt that today’s memory technologies will stop scaling, and that new memory technologies will need to replace today’s leading technologies both in the embedded and stand-alone spaces. This includes DRAM, NAND flash, NOR flash, and SRAM. Because this outlook is held by nearly everyone in the industry, all major memory manufacturers are investing in alternative memory technologies. The leading players are researching multiple technologies at the same time.

Meanwhile, the industry outlook has allowed many university research projects and other similar efforts to gain funding to develop new memory types, spawning a large number of small single-technology companies tightly focused on one technology or another: ReRAM, MRAM, FRAM, and others, including such highly-differentiated technologies as carbon nanotubes and printable polymers.

## FPGAs Significance for Trading

Latency remains the primary bottleneck in high-frequency trading, and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays effectively eliminate it by executing trading algorithms directly in hardware. Unlike CPUs or GPUs, FPGAs can implement fully customized logic, stripping away software layers that slow execution, which makes them perfect for order book management, market data decoding, and pre-trade risk checks.

Content: One of the most popular integrated circuits that Xilinx produces is an FPGA. This stands for Field Programmable Gate Array. But, again, what does this mean? We can configure this type of integrated circuit in many different ways and areas.

The company Xilinx has been producing FPGAs for several years now. They have managed to produce different FPGA models, all suited to certain uses. This has meant that even though their FPGAs did not dominate the market for long, they are still very popular.

Another thing that makes Xilinx stand out from the crowd of FPGA producers is that they produce the chips and software and hardware integration tools.

Content: ## Major FPGA Manufacturers: Xilinx and Altera

There are several companies worldwide that produce FPGAs, but an overwhelming 80 percent of the total production is dominated by two key players: Xilinx and Altera.

Now, you might have heard that in 2015, Intel acquired Altera, which means that Altera is now part of the Intel family.

As a result, their FPGAs are referred to as Intel FPGAs, and we no longer use the Altera name.

In a different turn of events, AMD acquired Xilinx in 2020.

However, despite this change in ownership, Xilinx's FPGA products are still referred to as Xilinx FPGAs, and you can access their website just as you did before.

This differs from the Altera scenario, where if you try to visit the old website URL, you'll be redirected to the FPGA product section of the Intel website.

According to statistics from 2020, around 52 percent of FPGAs were produced by Xilinx, while Intel accounted for 35 percent.

The remaining market share, which is relatively small, is distributed among other FPG...

Europe Company Universe Gap Analysis (2024)

1. Memory Manufacturers (DRAM, NAND, Specialty Memory)
- Infineon Technologies (IFX) is the only major publicly traded European company with significant memory (including DRAM, specialty) operations. Verified via Mordor Intelligence and Statista.
- STMicroelectronics (STM) produces some specialty/embedded memory (EEPROM, NOR, etc.), but is not a major DRAM/NAND supplier.
- No other large, publicly traded European DRAM or NAND manufacturers found. Most global DRAM/NAND is produced by Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron, Nanya, Winbond, Kioxia, etc. (Asia/US).
- Integral Memory Plc (UK) is a private company, not publicly traded.
- Hyperstone (Germany) is a private flash controller company, not a major DRAM/NAND supplier.
- Conclusion: No major gaps for publicly traded European memory manufacturers. Infineon and STM are correctly included; no other large names found in 2024 sources.

2. Additional Hardware Firms (FPGA, Storage Controllers, HPC Integrators)
- FPGA: No major publicly traded European pure-play FPGA manufacturers. Menta (France) is private. Infineon and STM offer some programmable logic, but not at the scale of Xilinx/Intel (US).
- Storage Controllers: Hyperstone (Germany) is private. No major publicly traded European storage controller firms found.
- HPC Integrators: Atos (France) is a major publicly traded European HPC integrator and supercomputing vendor (Euronext: ATO). Atos is missing from the current list and should be added. Verified via Bacula Systems, Wikipedia, and Euronext.

3. Other Observations
- All major European AI chip, networking, and data center infrastructure companies are present.
- Segment assignments are accurate and sources are valid.

4. Recommendations
- Add Atos SE (ATO | France) as a high-performance computing integrator and supercomputing vendor.
- No other major gaps for memory, FPGA, or storage controller segments among publicly traded European firms.

Title: AI in Europe: Key AI industry trends and investment insights

Content: ## AI investment landscape in Europe today

According to Pitchbook, European AI companies raised over $13B in 2024 – marking a 22% increase in capital invested, even as deal volume declined by 31% year-over-year. The increase in capital, despite the drop in deal volume, signals a consolidation of funding among established frontrunners across core LLMs, generative AI application layers, AI automation and deep tech. Some of the most active European investors fueling this growth include BPI France, LocalGlobe, Balderton, Index Ventures and Atomico. All have played a significant role in backing AI-driven startups across the region.

The U.K. remains a dominant AI hub, securing nearly $6B in AI funding in 2024—more than France and Germany combined (refer to chart below). However, France is rapidly catching up with Mistral AI emerging as the region’s leading LLM provider after raising over $1B within one year of its founding. Meanwhile, Germany’s AI sector remains deeply tied to its industrial roots, where advanced...

The increase in capital, despite the drop in deal volume, signals a consolidation of funding among established frontrunners across core LLMs, generative AI application layers, AI automation and deep tech. Some of the most active European investors fueling this growth include BPI France, LocalGlobe, Balderton, Index Ventures and Atomico. All have played a significant role in backing AI-driven startups across the region.\n\nThe U.K. remains a dominant AI hub, securing nearly $6B in AI funding in 2024—more than France and Germany combined (refer to chart below). However, France is rapidly catching up with Mistral AI emerging as the region’s leading LLM provider after raising over $1B within one year of its founding.

Managing Medical Device software risks for AI effectively requires a structured approach. To standardize this process, we created a flexible AI Risk Management template. This template is primarily based on the EU AI Act, with guidance from ISO standards. Given that ISO standards are not yet harmonized with the EU AI Act, our approach ensures compliance with current regulations while integrating best practices from established risk management frameworks. These standards offer valuable insights and methodologies for risk management.

To understand the differences and unique aspects of these standards, let’s compare ISO 14971 with the EU AI Act, ISO 23894, and ISO 31000.

Title: PESTLE Analysis of Ericsson
URL: https://canvasbusinessmodel.com/products/ericsson-pestle-analysis
Content: ## Political factors

Ericsson's global operations are heavily shaped by government regulations and telecommunications policies. For instance, regulations on 5G deployment and spectrum auctions are crucial. In 2024, spectrum auctions in India and Europe significantly influenced Ericsson's market strategies. The company's ability to navigate these policies is essential for its market access and financial performance.

Geopolitical tensions, including the U.S.-China trade war, pose risks. These tensions can disrupt supply chains and lead to tariff implications on telecommunications equipment. Ericsson's operational stability could be impacted as a result. The company is actively diversifying its supply chain to mitigate these risks. In 2024, Ericsson's sales in North America were approximately SEK 58.5 billion.

Ericsson lobbies for policies supporting broadband and 5G. In 2024, global 5G subscriptions neared 1.9 billion, driving infrastructure investments. Ericsson's advocacy aims to capitalize on the growing ...

THE FUTURE OF EUROPEAN COMPETITIVENESS — PART A | ACKNOWLEDGMENT... The global decarbonisation drive is also a growth opportunity for EU industry. The EU is a world leader in clean 
technologies like wind turbines, electrolysers and low-carbon fuels, and more than one-fifth of clean and sustainable 
technologies worldwide are developed here.
Yet it is not guaranteed that Europe will seize this opportunity. Chinese competition is becoming acute in industries 
like clean tech and electric vehicles, driven by a powerful combination of massive industrial policy and subsidises, 
rapid innovation, control of raw materials and ability to produce at continent-wide scale.
The EU faces a possible trade-off. Increasing reliance on China may offer the cheapest and most efficient route 
to meeting our decarbonisation targets. But China’s state-sponsored competition also r...

EU maintains its current productivity growth rate, it 
would only be enough to keep GDP constant until 2050. 
According to the report, the EU should balance 
climate ambitions with economic competitiveness.  
Industrial energy costs are higher in the EU than in other 
developed economies. Moreover, the commitment to 
transition comes with substantial investment needs.  
To address this challenge, the report proposes a

Ericsson provides telecom equipment and services that are primarily used to build and operate mobile networks. The firm divides its business into three segments: networks, cloud and software services, and enterprise. Wireless carriers have traditionally been the firm’s primary customers, but it is pushing to cater more to enterprises as well, as both try to take advantage of 5G capabilities and utilize “as-a-service” communications platforms. The company also licenses its patents to handset manufacturers.

For the reporting year 2024, Nokia is preparing the 
Sustainability Statement for the first time in accordance with 
the requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive 2022/2464/EU of the European Parliament and 
of the Council (hereinafter “CSRD”) and requirements of the 
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 of 31 July 
2023 (hereafter the “Delegated Regulation”) as regards the 
European Sustainability Reporting Standards (hereafter 
“ESRS”). When referring to the various ESRS, the numbering in 
the Delegated Regulation is used. Finland transposed these 
requirements into national law on 21 December 2023, and they 
are in effect for the financial year 2024. These requirements 
are applicable to Nokia by virtue of Art. 3 and Art. 19a of

Security Supplier Management SSM – Strategic Supplier Management sentiment analysis

European companies may face a dual challenge as the U.S. seemingly shifts its strategic focus, which may necessitate measures to assess risk and potentially reduce reliance on American based technology firms. The new US administration has signaled an increasing prioritization of its own domestic manufacturing, which has increased the specter of raising tariffs on EU goods like automobiles and machinery to shrink its $200 billion goods deficit – while simultaneously redirecting resources to counter China’s economic and political challenges across the globe. This pivot may leave EU firms exposed, as the US has signaled it can’t indefinitely sustain its central role in European security and be China’s rival. Economically, the EU may retaliate with tariffs on US services, particularly technology, where American firms like Google and Microsoft dominate, driving a $131 billion US ...

Content: # Geopolitical Risks Reshaping Global 5G Infrastructure Investment: Assessing the Long-Term Impact of China's Network Vendor Restrictions on Ericsson and NokiaWritten byMarcus Lee

- China's exclusion of Ericsson and Nokia from 5G infrastructure slashed their combined China market share to 4% by 2023 due to cybersecurity reviews and localization demands.

- The firms are pivoting to B2B technologies and 6G R&D while urging Europe to close $450B investment gaps to counter China's state-backed 5G dominance.

- Geopolitical tensions risk fracturing global telecom standards, creating parallel 5G/6G ecosystems with China's cost-driven model versus U.S.-aligned security-focused alternatives.

- European firms face existential threats as 75% of EU Chamber members report lost business, with retaliatory export controls potentially escalating market volatility.

Content: Executive Summary
European energy-intensive industries (EIIs) face significant challenges and seek opportunities 
to adapt
European energy-intensive industries (EIIs) are committed to decarbonisation and the EU’s 
climate targets. The EU’s EIIs acknowledge their responsibility in Europe’s green transition and have 
therefore committed to ambitious net-zero targets, often exceeding what EU regulations impose and 
taking the lead in rolling out lighthouse projects. However, four key factors are putting pressure on 
business models and competitiveness: (1) the burden of comparatively high energy prices; (2) the 
constraint of limited access to renewable1 energy sources; (3) the weight of high CO₂-related costs; 
and (4) the substantial investment required to facilitate decarbonisation.
The potential consequences of these factors are price increases and deindustrialisation. If the 
increased production costs can be passed on to customers, production stays in Europe, and prices 
increase. However, export business ...

I
n 2024, Legrand fully achieved its annual objectives,
once again demonstrating its ability to navigate a
complex market and generate solid results. 
Sales growth, both organic and through acquisitions,
amounted to +3.9%, while the adjusted operating
margin reached 20.5% after acquisitions. The Group's net
profit was 13.5% of revenue, and free cash flow represented
1.3 billion euros, or 14.9% of revenue. The Group also made
significant progress in its CSR Roadmap, with an
achievement rate of 113%. 
2024 saw a sharp rise in datacenter activity, which now
represent 20% of the Group's revenue(1). Legrand also
announced nine acquisitions over the past twelve months,
strengthening its strategic positions and expanding its
product portfolio. These acquisitions, combined with a
sustained pace of new product launches, contributed to
maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction.

Content: # Energy Transition Risks in Central Europe: Geopolitical Exposure and Portfolio ResilienceWritten byRhys Northwood

- Central Europe's energy transition faces geopolitical risks from Ukraine war, U.S.-China competition, and EU decarbonization pressures.

- Post-2023 energy shifts to U.S. LNG and gas infrastructure risk stranded assets as efficiency gains reduce demand.

- EU relies on China for 80% of critical mineral processing, exposing supply chains to export controls and bottlenecks.

- Critical Raw Materials Act aims to boost domestic production but faces regulatory delays in Germany and other CEE nations.

- Investors must diversify energy sources and mineral supply chains while supporting regional interconnectors and recycling initiatives.

The energy transition in Central Europe has become a geopolitical battleground, shaped by the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, U.S.-China competition, and the EU's ambitious decarbonization agenda. While the region is pivotal to Europe's energy security a...

Title: [PDF] The future of European competitiveness - Le Grand Continent

Content: The EU’s competitiveness gap compared vis-à-vis its trade partners is not only related to very high prices, but also to the high level of volatility and the unpredictability of prices in EU compared to other world regions. After almost a decade of limited price volatility, in late 2019 and early 2022 volatility in natural gas markets increased significantly, driven first by the COVID-19 pandemic and later by the energy crisis [see Figure 3]. This translated into high volatility in electricity markets also affected by lower output from hydro and nuclear energy in 2022. High degrees of volatility in energy markets, which appear to have become more structural, pose a real threat to the EU’s competitiveness. High volatility creates uncertainty, increases price of hedging, and can be detrimental to investment decisions in the power sector. This generates even greater uncertainty, including from the point of view of the security of supply,... of consumption [see the chapter on energy-intensive industries for a more...

Content: The technology and services sectors continued to perform well but manufacturing faced challenges due to weak global demand and overcapacities. Inflation, while declining from peak levels, remained a concern, influencing monetary policy throughout the year. Europe's economic performance in calendar 2024 was sluggish, with core economies such as Germany showing the second consecutive year of recession due to a combination of structural problems, especially in energy-intensive industries and key sectors such as automotive, and also due to cyclical weakness including low global goods demand which weighed on important industries for the economy such as machine-building. Germany’s real GDP was barely above pre-COVID-19 levels while industrial production was 12% lower than the level in 2018, meaning the industrial sector has been shrinking for more than half a decade. Southern Europe, especially Spain and Greece, fared much better, benefitting from strong tourism, service sector recovery and recent structural reform...

Content: Siemens’ Five Levers for a Sustainable and Competitive European Union | 2024
Unrestricted | © Siemens 2024 3
The European Union stands at a crossroads: The words of former European Commission President Jacques Delors are
more accurate than ever: “The only choice Europe has is between survival and decline.”
Back then, Europe faced the challenge of globalization and the Single Market was seen as a necessity. Today, European
companies operate in an increasingly volatile and fragmented global environment, while barriers to the EU’s Single
Market still remain. Rising energy prices and inflation, supply chain delays and shortages, a lack of skilled labor as well as
an increasingly complex regulatory framework are heavily impacting companies operating in Europe, while these
companies must adapt and invest to remain competitive. At the same time, we face common climate and environmental
challenges that require changes to our way of living, working, producing and consuming to secure a sustainable future.

Siemens Energy (SIEGY), the global powerhouse in energy infrastructure, has positioned itself as a survivor amid escalating U.S. import tariffs. While the company acknowledges tariffs will trim profits in 2025—by up to €100 million—the broader narrative is one of strategic mitigation and operational strength. However, the path ahead is fraught with supply chain hurdles, regulatory uncertainty, and a shifting hydrogen market that could test its resilience.

**The Financial Buffer: Tariffs, Price Hikes, and a Bulging Backlog**

Siemens Energy’s guidance for fiscal 2025 reflects a calculated response to tariffs. The company expects a “limited direct impact” of up to €100 million on profits, a fraction of its projected €1 billion net income. This optimism stems from...

Content: ## PESTEL Analysis of - ABB Ltd

PESTEL analysis of ABB Ltd, formatted as requested, and incorporating the latest available data and insights as of March 27, 2025.

**Introduction**

ABB Ltd, a global technology leader in electrification, robotics, automation, and motion, operates in a complex and dynamic macro-environment. This PESTEL analysis examines the key political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal factors that significantly impact ABB's operations in the United States and globally, providing a framework for strategic decision-making and risk mitigation.... ## Political Factors

The global political landscape presents both opportunities and challenges for ABB. The rise of protectionist policies, particularly in key markets like the United States, impacts ABB's international operations. For example, tariffs on imported components can increase production costs and affect pricing strategies. The US-China trade tensions, while fluctuating, continue to create uncertainty for global s...

Manufacturers are forced to pay more for electricity in Europe than in the US and China, where the overall regulatory environment also tends to be more favorable, the chief of the Swiss engineering company said in an interview in London.

“The cost for energy intense industries like chemical, steel production, cement is a challenge, and investments will go elsewhere than Europe if this continues,” Wierod said. This could weigh on job creation in the region, “which is a clear concern.”

Wierod’s concerns have been underlined by a stream of bad news from European industrial companies in recent weeks. Thyssenkrupp AG’s steel unit on Monday announced plans to reduce its workforce by around 40% this decade to become ...

BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE
1.1 SUSTAINABILITY AT THE HEART OF PRYSMIAN’S REPORTING 
Letter from the Chief Executive Officer and the Chair of the Sustainability Committee
The year 2022 confirmed the urgency of the energy 
transition towards renewable sources and, to a greater 
degree, of electrification, not only with a view to 
speeding up decarbonisation processes, but also to 
allowing Europe to strongly reduce its dependence on 
natural gas and oil exporting countries
It is therefore increasingly clear that developing 
adequate grid infrastructure is a fundamental 
requirement for exploiting wind and solar power and 
supporting electrification processes in all critical 
sectors. In this scenario, cable technology takes on 
even greater strategic importance. 
To further increase the credibility of our ambition 
of being a global leading player in the challenges of 
decarbonisation, we are incre...
