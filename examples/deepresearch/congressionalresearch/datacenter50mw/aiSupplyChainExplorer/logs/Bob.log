The scenario models quantify the impact of baseline growth, export bans, and a 20% increase in energy prices on company revenues and margins over a three-year horizon (2024–2026/2027).\n\nMethodology:\n- Regional financial modelers compiled scenario projections for each company, referencing annual reports, earnings transcripts, and regulatory/market outlooks.\n- Three scenarios were modeled for each company: Baseline (expected growth), Export Ban (10% revenue impact and margin compression for exposed regions), and +20% Energy Price (margin impact based on energy cost sensitivity).\n- All figures are in USD; FX rates and conversion notes are included where relevant.\n- Scenario data was validated for consistency with reported segment totals and cross-checked with at least two sources per company when possible.\n\nKey Findings:\n- Baseline scenarios reflect robust AI-driven growth for data center, semiconductor, and networking firms, with margin expansion in most cases as scale and efficiency improve.\n- Export ban scenarios show significant revenue and margin risk for companies with high exposure to China/Asia or US/EU markets, though some adaptation is modeled over time.\n- A 20% energy price increase has a measurable but generally manageable impact on margins, with the effect varying by company and region depending on energy intensity and ability to pass through costs.\n- The scenario matrix enables comparative risk assessment and stress-testing of the AI-hardware supply chain under plausible regulatory and macroeconomic shocks.\n\nSources and Provenance:\n- All scenario lines in scenarios.txt include direct links to primary financial filings, earnings calls, and regulatory/market analysis.\n- Regional scenario files (na_scenarios.txt, europe_scenarios.txt, asia_scenarios.txt) were merged and validated for completeness and consistency.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Downstream analysis will integrate these scenario outputs with supply-chain and risk matrix data to inform strategic planning and risk mitigation for ecosystem participants.\n\n---base_commit_hash---\n0129a2f9ce9156f3444840e38b255bac748125dd'}

The scenario models quantify the impact of baseline growth, export bans, and a 20% increase in energy prices on company revenues and margins over a three-year horizon (2024–2026/2027).\n\nMethodology:\n- Regional financial modelers compiled scenario projections for each company, referencing annual reports, earnings transcripts, and regulatory/market outlooks.\n- Three scenarios were modeled for each company: Baseline (expected growth), Export Ban (10% revenue impact and margin compression for exposed regions), and +20% Energy Price (margin impact based on energy cost sensitivity).\n- All figures are in USD; FX rates and conversion notes are included where relevant.\n- Scenario data was validated for consistency with reported segment totals and cross-checked with at least two sources per company when possible.\n\nKey Findings:\n- Baseline scenarios reflect robust AI-driven growth for data center, semiconductor, and networking firms, with margin expansion in most cases as scale and efficiency improve.\n- Export ban scenarios show significant revenue and margin risk for companies with high exposure to China/Asia or US/EU markets, though some adaptation is modeled over time.\n- A 20% energy price increase has a measurable but generally manageable impact on margins, with the effect varying by company and region depending on energy intensity and ability to pass through costs.\n- The scenario matrix enables comparative risk assessment and stress-testing of the AI-hardware supply chain under plausible regulatory and macroeconomic shocks.\n\nIntegration Notes (Supply Network & Risk Matrix):\n- Regional supply edge lists (Asia, Europe, NA) were merged into supply_network.txt. No format conflicts; all entries standardized to: source_company | relationship | target_company | strength.\n- Regional risk matrices (Asia, Europe, NA) were merged into risk_matrix.txt. All entries retain original notes and sources; minor differences in risk language (e.g., "major" vs. "strong") were preserved for fidelity.\n- No duplicate or conflicting entries detected in merged files. All provenance and source links retained for traceability.\n\nSources and Provenance:\n- All scenario, supply chain, and risk matrix lines include direct links to primary financial filings, earnings calls, and regulatory/market analysis.\n- Regional files were merged and validated for completeness and consistency.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Downstream analysis will integrate these scenario, supply chain, and risk outputs to inform strategic planning and risk mitigation for ecosystem participants.\n\n---base_commit_hash---\n9e53193092c7bf831dc32d97f87b39d004d8a4f8'}

The scenario models quantify the impact of baseline growth, export bans, and a 20% increase in energy prices on company revenues and margins over a three-year horizon (2024–2026/2027).\n\nMethodology:\n- Regional financial modelers compiled scenario projections for each company, referencing annual reports, earnings transcripts, and regulatory/market outlooks.\n- Three scenarios were modeled for each company: Baseline (expected growth), Export Ban (10% revenue impact and margin compression for exposed regions), and +20% Energy Price (margin impact based on energy cost sensitivity).\n- All figures are in USD; FX rates and conversion notes are included where relevant.\n- Scenario data was validated for consistency with reported segment totals and cross-checked with at least two sources per company when possible.\n\nKey Findings:\n- Baseline scenarios reflect robust AI-driven growth for data center, semiconductor, and networking firms, with margin expansion in most cases as scale and efficiency improve.\n- Export ban scenarios show significant revenue and margin risk for companies with high exposure to China/Asia or US/EU markets, though some adaptation is modeled over time.\n- A 20% energy price increase has a measurable but generally manageable impact on margins, with the effect varying by company and region depending on energy intensity and ability to pass through costs.\n- The scenario matrix enables comparative risk assessment and stress-testing of the AI-hardware supply chain under plausible regulatory and macroeconomic shocks.\n\nIntegration Notes (Supply Network & Risk Matrix):\n- Regional supply edge lists (Asia, Europe, NA) were merged into supply_network.txt. No format conflicts; all entries standardized to: source_company | relationship | target_company | strength.\n- Regional risk matrices (Asia, Europe, NA) were merged into risk_matrix.txt. All entries retain original notes and sources; minor differences in risk language (e.g., "major" vs. "strong") were preserved for fidelity.\n- No duplicate or conflicting entries detected in merged files. All provenance and source links retained for traceability.\n\nSources and Provenance:\n- All scenario, supply chain, and risk matrix lines include direct links to primary financial filings, earnings calls, and regulatory/market analysis.\n- Regional files were merged and validated for completeness and consistency.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Downstream analysis will integrate these scenario, supply chain, and risk outputs to inform strategic planning and risk mitigation for ecosystem participants.\n\n---base_commit_hash---\n9e53193092c7bf831dc32d97f87b39d004d8a4f8'}
