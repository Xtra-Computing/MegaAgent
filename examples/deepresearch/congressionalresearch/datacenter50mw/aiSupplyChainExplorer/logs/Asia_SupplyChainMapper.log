*Don’t Count Samsung Out in the AI Memory Stakes© Provided by The Wall Street Journal*

South Korean technology giant Samsung Electronics has fallen behind in the artificial-intelligence race—at least in the first heat.

It would be foolish to count it out, though. Recent signs indicate it might be narrowing the technological gap with rivals SK Hynix and Micron in high-performance AI memory chips. Even if it takes longer than expected to catch up, a tighter overall memory market thanks to the AI boom could still be a significant tailwind for Samsung.

Nvidia’s AI chips have been selling like hot cakes since the rise of generative AI apps such as ChatGPT. Memory-chip makers have, in turn, sold out their high-performance products to Nvidia and others. High-bandwidth memory, or HBM, offers enhanced data-processing speed, which is crucial for AI number crunching.

Korea’s SK Hynix has taken an early lead in HBM. It is virtually the only supplier to Nvidia for the latest-generation m...

It's going to be easier said than done, though, as Samsung continues to face challenges in securing orders from major AI chip designers like NVIDIA to rivals like SK Hynix and TSMC. SK Hynix has won exclusive supply rights for select high bandwidth memory NVIDIA chips and TSMC has been contracted to produce NVIDIA's H100 GPU.

Things have already been challenging for Samsung in the memory chip market. Its DRAM market share has reduced to 38.9% in Q3 2023 compared to SK Hynix's 34.3%. It's also lagging behind TSMC and Intel in foundry sales.

Samsung is now looking at a turnkey strategy to leverage its strengths in chip production, large scale integration, chip design, and foundry manufacturing. It seeks to collaborate with OpenAI, the company behind the wildly popular ChatGPT, as it views the company as a big partner for its chip strategy.

## 274% profit increase belies missed deadlines, botched launches, and scrambling leadership

Comment Despite reporting a seemingly impressive 274 percent increase in operating profit for calendar Q3 2024, Samsung Electronics is in crisis mode. Beneath these financials lies a semiconductor strategy that is unraveling, posing serious challenges for the South Korean tech giant.

The company last week issued a public apology to investors, customers, and employees, indicating awareness of the hurdles it faces. The reported profits mask deeper issues, including missed market opportunities, competitive setbacks, and a leadership shake-up that suggests internal turmoil.

At the core of Samsung's difficulties is a series of missteps in its semiconductor business. The company had promised substantial advancements to investors, betting heavily on technologies like its 12-layer HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) chips. However, these efforts were marred by failu...

Content: **Samsung Keeping Pace with Generative AI

**The pulse of generative AI is racing at a pace that will require the top players in the memory market to produce unparalleled bandwidth, needed to keep up with the number-crunching intensity required by AI/ML and other high-performance computing workloads. Samsung is leading the pack with its latest 5th generation high bandwidth memory (HBM) device: HBM3E 12H DRAM. This device is designed to give a significant edge to high-demand systems, data centers, AI applications, and advanced graphics-unit processors that power AI computing.

**HBM3E Power and Performance

**Starting from the ground up, this impressive new DRAM device is based on the 4th generation 10-nanometer node process and is built on high-k metal gate (HKMG) technology that replaces the former insulation layers with material that reduces electrical current leakage. This, along with strategic internal circuit optimization, increases performance and improves the device power efficiency by 12% compared to ...

Title: High Bandwidth Memory
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory
Content: According to Ryan Smith of *AnandTech*, the SK Hynix first generation HBM3 memory has the same density as their latest-generation HBM2E memory, meaning that device vendors looking to increase their total memory capacities for their next-generation parts would need to use memory with 12 dies/layers, up from the 8 layer stacks they typically used until then. According to Anton Shilov of *Tom's Hardware*, high-performance compute GPUs or FPGAs typically use four or six HBM stacks, so with SK Hynix's HBM3 24 GB stacks they would accordingly get 3.2 TB/s or 4.9 TB/s of memory bandwidth. He also noted that SK Hynix's HBM3 chips are square, not rectangular like HBM2 and HBM2E chips. According to Chris Mellor of *The Register*, with JEDEC not yet having developed its HBM3 standard, might mean that SK Hynix would need to retrofit its design to a future and faster one.

JEDEC officially announced the HBM3 standard on January 27, 2022. The number of memory channels was doubled from 8 channels of 128 bits with HBM2e to 1...

Samsung Electronics has secured a key supply deal with AMD, with its fifth-generation 12-layer HBM3E memory selected for the chipmaker's upcoming MI350 AI accelerators. The move marks a breakthrough for Samsung, which has repeatedly lost out to rivals like Nvidia, and helps ease concerns about the reliability of its HBM technology.
With the deal confirmed, Samsung is buoyed by the momentum, especially as expectations grow for future HBM4 (sixth-generation HBM) supply to AMD's MI400 series, set to launch next year. Industry observers also believe Samsung may begin supplying HBM3E to Nvidia as early as this month, potentially accelerating the company's HBM business in the second half.
AMD announced at its Advancing AI 2025 event in San Jose, California on June 12 that Samsung and Micron's 12-layer HBM3E will be used in its new MI350X and MI355X AI accelerators. While Samsung's supply to AMD had been widely assumed, this marks the first time AMD h...

Content: In late 2024, marked by key developments across the tech landscape, Samsung Electronics successfully positioned itself in the AI memory supply chain by preparing for the introduction of its next-generation HBM3E chips for Nvidia's cutting-edge Blackwell architecture. Reports from November indicated that Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, was accelerating the approval process, which was seen as a significant step for Samsung to enhance its influence in the AI semiconductor market. The anticipation around the HBM3E chips grew stronger with industry reports suggesting impending approvals for both 8-stack and 12-stack configurations, heightening expectations about Samsung's performance amidst the competitive landscape dominated by SK Hynix and Micron. By mid-December 2024, it became evident that Samsung's commitment to high-performance memory production would not only reinforce its reputation in the sector but would also rejuvenate its AI semiconductor revenue streams in early 2025 and beyond.

Beneath these financials lies a semiconductor strategy that is unraveling, posing serious challenges for the South Korean tech giant.\n\nThe company last week issued a public apology to investors, customers, and employees, indicating awareness of the hurdles it faces. The reported profits mask deeper issues, including missed market opportunities, competitive setbacks, and a leadership shake-up that suggests internal turmoil.\n\nAt the core of Samsung's difficulties is a series of missteps in its semiconductor business. The company had promised substantial advancements to investors, betting heavily on technologies like its 12-layer HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) chips. However, these efforts were marred by failu...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 3:\nTitle: Leading Memory Innovation with HBM3E - Samsung Semiconductor\nURL: https://semiconductor.samsung.com/news-events/tech-blog/leading-memory-innovation-with-hbm3e/\nContent: **Samsung Keeping Pace with Generative AI\n\n**The pulse of generative AI is racing at a pace that will require the top players in the memory market to produce unparalleled bandwidth, needed to keep up with the number-crunching intensity required by AI/ML and other high-performance computing workloads. Samsung is leading the pack with its latest 5th generation high bandwidth memory (HBM) device: HBM3E 12H DRAM. This device is designed to give a significant edge to high-demand systems, data centers, AI applications, and advanced graphics-unit processors that power AI computing.\n\n**HBM3E Power and Performance\n\n**Starting from the ground up, this impressive new DRAM device is based on the 4th generation 10-nanometer node process and is built on high-k metal gate (HKMG) technology that replaces the former insulation layers with material that reduces electrical current leakage. This, along with strategic internal circuit optimization, increases performance and improves the device power efficiency by 12% compared to ...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 4:\nTitle: High Bandwidth Memory\nURL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory\nContent: According to Ryan Smith of *AnandTech*, the SK Hynix first generation HBM3 memory has the same density as their latest-generation HBM2E memory, meaning that device vendors looking to increase their total memory capacities for their next-generation parts would need to use memory with 12 dies/layers, up from the 8 layer stacks they typically used until then. According to Anton Shilov of *Tom's Hardware*, high-performance compute GPUs or FPGAs typically use four or six HBM stacks, so with SK Hynix's HBM3 24 GB stacks they would accordingly get 3.2 TB/s or 4.9 TB/s of memory bandwidth.

Research — JUNE 03, 2025

The global memory semiconductor market—dominated by Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (KRX: 005930), SK hynix Inc. (KRX: 000660), and Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU)—is seeing a significant shift. SK Hynix is poised to overtake Samsung as the leading DRAM supplier by revenue in 2025, according to Visible Alpha consensus estimates, marking a shift in the industry’s competitive landscape.

Long the dominant force in DRAM, Samsung is now facing intense competition from its smaller domestic rival. SK Hynix's ascent has been supercharged by the explosive grow...

Title: High Bandwidth Memory: SK hynix's AI edge - Vastkind
URL: https://www.vastkind.com/insights-high-bandwidth-memory-sk-hynix-ai-supply-war/
Content: ## Introduction

If compute was the headline of the AI boom,

**memory is the plot twist**. The training and serving of large models is running headfirst into the **memory wall**: bandwidth and capacity—not raw FLOPS—are the choke points that decide system performance and total cost. The result? **High Bandwidth Memory (HBM)** has vaulted from niche to necessity.

No company rode this shift harder than

**SK hynix**. In just two years, HBM went from ~5% of the company’s DRAM sales to **over 40% by early 2025**, propelled by orders from Nvidia and hyperscalers racing to stand up “AI factories.” Financial Times

HBM isn’t a component anymore. It’s the

allocation that determines who ships AI at scale.

## The Tech in Plain English: Why HBM Changes Everything

HBM achieves extreme bandwidth by

**stacking DRAM dies** and wiring them with through-silicon vias, then placing those stacks **next to the GPU/accelerator** on a silicon interposer. The result is a **much wider interface** (1,024 bits in HBM3/3E; **2,048...

Content: SK hynix presented its leading memory solutions optimized for AI servers and AI PCs at Dell Technologies World (DTW) 2025 in Las Vegas from May 19–22.

Hosted by Dell Technologies, DTW is an annual conference which introduces future technology trends. In line with DTW 2025’s theme of “Accelerate from Ideas to Innovation,” a wide range of products and technologies aimed at driving AI innovation was showcased at the event.

Based on its close partnership with Dell, SK hynix has participated in the event every year to reinforce its leadership in AI. This year, the company organized its booth into six sections: HBM,

1 CMM (CXL 2 Memory Module)-DDR5, server DRAM, PC DRAM, eSSDs 3, and cSSDs 4. Featuring products with strong competitiveness across all areas of DRAM and NAND flash for the AI server, storage and PC markets, the booth garnered strong attention from visitors.

Title: SK Hynix has 'sold out' of HBM DRAMs for 2024
URL: https://www.eenewseurope.com/en/sk-hynix-has-sold-out-of-hbm-drams-for-2024/
Content: ## SK Hynix has sold out of DRAMs in the stacked high-bandwidth memory (HBM) format that is used in AI processors for the data center for the whole of 2024, according to a senior executive.

“Our planned production volume of HBM this year has already sold out,” said the recently appointed vice president Kitae Kim, head of HBM sales & marketing, in an interview posted on SK Hynix’ website on February 21.

A lack of HBM3 and HBM3E format chips could put an effective limit on the growth of both the memory and logic portions of the semiconductor industry in 2024.

HBM is a DRAM-based product that achieves higher data processing speeds compared to single-plane DRAMs by vertically connecting multiple DRAMs with through-silicon via (TSV) and bumps. There are five generations of HBM, starting with the original HBM and followed by HBM2, HBM2E, HBM3, and HBM3E – an extended version of HBM3.

It should be noted that Kim referenced “planned production” so the company is no doubt scrambling to bring up additional capacity...

Title: SK hynix reports record Q1 with soaring demand for HBM chips

Content: SK hynix saw first 2024 quarter revenues soar 144 percent as demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips rocketed.

The DRAM and NAND manufacturer reported ₩12.43 trillion ($9.03 billion) in revenues with a ₩1.92 trillion ($1.4 billion) profit compared to last year’s ₩2.6 trillion ($1.9 billion) loss. This was a record first quarter revenue amount. DRAM accounted for 61 percent of its revenue and NAND 35 percent, with the remainder coming from other activities.

CFO Kim Woohyun said: “With the industry’s best technology in the AI memory space led by HBM, we have entered a clear recovery phase.”

It attributed the rise to demand for its HBM in GPU-powered AI servers, with the GPUs needing HBM rather than x86 server-style socket-attached DRAM.

In order to keep the GPUs busy, more memory bandwidth and capacity is needed than can be supported by the socket-attach method, which connects planar (single layer) DRAM to CPUs. HBM is built up from multiple layers – 4, 8, or 12-high – with a more direct connection to ...

Title: SK Hynix's supplier shift triggers tensions in TC bonder market
URL: https://www.chosun.com/english/industry-en/2025/04/22/5QFCK3FZXVHTHADHKNIQDKGFXU/
Content: A power struggle is unfolding in South Korea's semiconductor industry as SK Hynix seeks to diversify its suppliers of thermal compression bonders (TC bonders), crucial for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chip production. HBM is created by stacking DRAM chips in eight or twelve layers, with the TC bonder playing a key role by applying heat and pressure to bond these layers together.
This shift is straining SK Hynix's long-standing relationship with Hanmi Semiconductor, its exclusive supplier of TC bonders, and bringing in challenger Hanwha Semitech. Hanwha's recent entry into the market has disrupted the industry, escalating tensions and leading to legal disputes.
Graphics by Yang Jin-kyung
Semiconductor industry sources reported on April 21 that Hanmi Semiconductor had withdrawn around 50 to 60 employees from SK Hynix's HBM production lines.

Content: SK Hynix's eight-year partnership with Hanmi Semiconductor is showing signs of strain after the memory chipmaker began sourcing thermal compression bonding machines from rival Hanwha Semitech, according to industry sources.

Hanmi, which has been the exclusive supplier of TC Bonders essential for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) production, has reportedly pulled all service engineers from SK Hynix's factories in an unprecedented move for the semiconductor equipment sector.

The dispute escalated in March when SK Hynix ordered 12 TC Bonders worth approximately US$29.6 million from Hanwha Semitech. Hanmi has already filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Hanwha related to the bonding technology.

Industry analysts warn the conflict could threaten South Korea's competitive edge in the HBM market, where SK Hynix holds an estimated 65% global market share. The partnership had been described as "inseparable as lips and teeth" since 2017, with Hanmi achieving record revenues of KRW558.9 billion in 2024 and operating...

Title: SK Hynix's supplier shift triggers tensions in TC bonder market
URL: https://www.chosun.com/english/industry-en/2025/04/22/5QFCK3FZXVHTHADHKNIQDKGFXU/
Content: A power struggle is unfolding in South Korea's semiconductor industry as SK Hynix seeks to diversify its suppliers of thermal compression bonders (TC bonders), crucial for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chip production. HBM is created by stacking DRAM chips in eight or twelve layers, with the TC bonder playing a key role by applying heat and pressure to bond these layers together.
This shift is straining SK Hynix's long-standing relationship with Hanmi Semiconductor, its exclusive supplier of TC bonders, and bringing in challenger Hanwha Semitech. Hanwha's recent entry into the market has disrupted the industry, escalating tensions and leading to legal disputes.
Graphics by Yang Jin-kyung
Semiconductor industry sources reported on April 21 that Hanmi Semiconductor had withdrawn around 50 to 60 employees from SK Hynix's HBM production lines. These staff members had been responsible for operating the TC bonders and managing production yields. Hanmi has also reportedly raised the price of the TC bonders by around 2...

Content: Hanmi Semiconductor Co., a South Korean developer of TC bonders, which is a key piece of equipment in the production of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), abruptly postponed its investor relations (IR) session on Monday.

The decision came shortly after executives from Korean memory chipmaker SK hynix Inc. visited the company on the same day. Industry insiders speculated that the two companies have reached a potential turning point in their strained relationship over TC bonder supply.

According to industry sources on Monday, Hanmi Semiconductor canceled its IR meeting with major domestic institutional investors, originally scheduled for Tuesday, and decided to reschedule the IR session after the release of its first-quarter earnings on May 15th, 2025.

“It seemed difficult for Hanmi to make any premature statements without having finalized its stance (on the issue),” a source said.

The relationship between Hanmi and SK hynix has shifted from trust to distrust.

On the 16th, SK Hynix officially announced its 'multi-vendor' strategy by ordering TC bonders to both Korea-U.S. Semiconductor and Hanwha Semitech at the same time. Until now, Hanmi Semiconductor, the sole TC bond supplier, strongly opposed Hanwha Semitech's new entry and made a strong move to withdraw equipment maintenance and repair personnel from SK Hynix, but started trading again. In the end, SK Hynix chose to diversify its supply chain. Hanwha Vision, the parent company of Hanwha Semitech, announced on the same day that it has signed a TC bond supply contract worth KRW 38.5 billion (excluding VAT) with SK Hynix.

Korea-U.S. Semiconductor also announced that it signed a supply contract worth 42.8 billion won on the same day. This is the first time that SK Hynix has or...

Title: Hanwha Semitech to supply 14 TC bonders to SK Hynix for HBM
URL: https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=5189
Content: Hanwha Semitech said on Friday that it has signed a 21 billion won deal to supply high-bandwidth memory (HBM) production equipment to SK Hynix.

The company, previously called Hanwha Precision Machinery, didn’t name the equipment but they are almost certainly thermal compression (TC) bonders.

Considering the size of the deal, it will be supplying 14 units of them to the chipmaker, sources said. It is Hanwha’s first time supplying the machinery.

SK Hynix currently use two TC bonders per one HBM process line so this means it will be installing seven HBM process lines with each of them using two units of bonders by Hanwha. This is a large deal for a first time supplier.

SK Hynix is planning to acquire as much as 80 units of TC bonders this year __ it initially planned for 50 but added another 30 due to explosive demand for HBMs.

Hanwha is expected to supply over 30 units out of this total. This means it will become the main supplier, beating rivals such as Hanmi Semiconductor and ASMPT.

Content: HANMI Semiconductor, which has been growing by supplying the TC bonder, a core equipment for high bandwidth memory (HBM), exclusively to SK hynix, has reached an inflection point.

This is because Hanwha Semiconductor has signed a supply contract worth 42 billion won with SK hynix, creating a crack in the exclusive system.

In this context, KWAK Dong-shin, chairman of HANMI Semiconductor, is reportedly laying the groundwork for the third generation succession by gifting equity worth 72.6 billion won to his two children.

**◇ Is SK's monopoly shaking? …Contract signed with Hanwha Semiconductor**

HANMI Semiconductor was established in 1980, based on HANMI Mold, founded by chairman KWAK Dong-shin's late father, KWAK No-gwon. This company has rapidly grown into a semiconductor equipment firm by exclusively supplying TC bonders to SK hynix for the past 8 years.

However, recently, SK hynix signed a supply contract with Hanwha Semiconductor, which is currently in a patent dispute with HANMI Semiconductor, leading ...

Title: Chart: Who Leads the Semiconductor Foundry Market?
URL: https://www.statista.com/chart/32653/market-share-of-semiconductor-foundries-by-revenue/
Content: Due to the success of companies like Nvidia or OpenAI, many people know about the AI arms race, the corresponding hype bubble and the chips required to power the underlying data centers. Fewer people know that even though Nvidia sells AI-focused products like their A100, H100 or B100 data center platforms, they don't produce the semiconductors themselves. This task falls to TSMC, a chip foundry from Taiwan. Foundries manufacture all kinds of semiconductors for companies that can't or won't produce chips themselves. And in the field of semiconductor foundries, no other company even comes close to TSMC's dominance.

Data from Counterpoint Research shows that in the first quarter of 2024 TSMC had a revenue-based market share of 62 percent. This is unsurprising, as TSMC has been manufacturing chips for Nvidia for decades and the latter is struggling to keep up with increasing demand for their hardware powering the AI gold rush. "We’ve observed more evidence to support that the AI demand is real, with increasing C...

SK hynix secured the #2 spot, reporting an impressive revenue growth of 94% YoY, driven by strong demand for HBM, particularly from data center customers such as NVIDIA. Qualcomm took the #3 position, with its semiconductor revenue enhanced by resilient growth in the automotive sector. The company is optimistic about its smartphone business, having raised its Q1 FY25 guidance while observing a mild recovery in the IoT segment. Intel, however, continued to experience weakness in Q3 2024 due to its nascent advanced chipmaking sales. Its advanced packaging business now supports foundry revenue and promotes alliances such as UCIe, which advances signal inter...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 8:\nTitle: Samsung overtakes Intel as the world’s top semiconductor provider\nURL: https://www.chosun.com/english/industry-en/2025/01/26/P4TLTUPWAVBM7KHV4FYYUQSTO4/\nContent: Samsung Electronics is set to reclaim its position as the world’s top semiconductor supplier for 2024, overtaking Intel, according to market research firm Gartner on Jan. 26. While this signals a comeback for Samsung, the rankings do not include Taiwan’s TSMC, the world’s largest foundry (semiconductor contract manufacturer).\n\nAfter struggling with declining profitability in DRAM and NAND flash products, Samsung Electronics appears to have achieved a notable rebound in sales last year.\n\nSK Hynix, the world’s second-largest memory chipmaker after Samsung Electronics, is expected to climb to fourth place. The chipmaker benefited from its leadership position in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) market, which has been rapidly growing amid surging demand for artificial intelligence. HBM is a crucial component of generative AI systems.\n\nGartner estimated global semiconductor sales to have reached $626 billion last year, up 18.1% from $530 billion in 2023. The combined revenue of the world’s top 25 semiconductor provi...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}

Content: In the third quarter of 2024, Samsung held a DRAM market share of 41.1 percent, while SK Hynix occupied a market share of 34.4 percent. Micron sat as the third-largest DRAM supplier with a market share of 22.2 percent during the third quarter of 2024.

## DRAM market fluctuations

Overall DRAM revenues amounted to 26.02 billion U.S. dollars for the third quarter of 2024, up from the 22.9 billion U.S. dollars observed in the second quarter of 2024. Samsung is the largest manufacturer of DRAM in terms of revenues.

## DRAM vs SRAM

The primary memory of a computer is called RAM, with the two most used forms of modern RAM being static RAM (SRAM) and dynamic RAM (DRAM). DRAM is a type of volatile memory which, unlike non-volatile flash memory, loses data quickly when cut off from a power supply. Compared to other varieties of volatile memory, DRAM is relatively structurally simple. Whereas SRAM requires four to six transistors per bit, DRAM requires only one transistor and capacitor per bit.

Micron sat as the third-largest DRAM supplier with a market share of 22.2 percent during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n## DRAM market fluctuations\n\nOverall DRAM revenues amounted to 26.02 billion U.S. dollars for the third quarter of 2024, up from the 22.9 billion U.S. dollars observed in the second quarter of 2024. Samsung is the largest manufacturer of DRAM in terms of revenues.\n\n## DRAM vs SRAM\n\nThe primary memory of a computer is called RAM, with the two most used forms of modern RAM being static RAM (SRAM) and dynamic RAM (DRAM). DRAM is a type of volatile memory which, unlike non-volatile flash memory, loses data quickly when cut off from a power supply. Compared to other varieties of volatile memory, DRAM is relatively structurally simple. Whereas SRAM requires four to six transistors per bit, DRAM requires only one transistor and capacitor per bit.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 8:\nTitle: Nanya | Edal Tech International Limited\nURL: https://www.edaltech.com/brands/nanya.html\nContent: Nanya\n\nNanya is a company dedicated to the R&D, design, manufacturing, and sales of DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory), ranking the number four in the global DRAM industry.

Content: Winbond Electronics, a manufacturer of specialty DRAM and flash memory, sustained operating losses throughout the first quarter of 2024, including a NT$464 million (US$14.4 million) net loss attributable to the parent company and NT$0.11 per share loss.

As the specialty memory market strengthened, Winbond's shipments surged in the first quarter, and its quarterly revenue grew to more than NT$20 billion, up 4.94% from the fourth quarter of last year and higher than the levels in each quarter of 2023. Winbond's first-quarter gross margin was 27.64%, down 0.82% from the fourth quarter of 2023. Nonetheless, the chipmaker's operations continued to incur losses.

In addition, Winbond's board of directors approved plans to issue 320 million common shares at NT$10 each, for a total of NT$3.2 billion. The additional funds will go toward the company's process and technology improvements.

Title: Winbond’s September Revenue Rises on Strong DRAM Transition and Balanced NOR Supply | JAKOTA News
URL: https://jakotaindex.com/news-hub/winbonds-september-revenue-rises-on-strong-dram-transition-and-balanced-nor-supply/
Content: # Winbond’s September Revenue Rises on Strong DRAM Transition and Balanced NOR Supply

Winbond Electronics reported September revenue of NT$7.231 billion, a 3.34% increase from August and up 6.87% year-over-year, marking the third-highest monthly revenue for 2024. Cumulative revenue for the first nine months reached NT$62.918 billion, up 12.69% compared to the same period in 2023, buoyed by solid growth across its DRAM, NOR, and NAND segments.

As part of its growth strategy, Winbond is transitioning from DDR3 to DDR4 DRAM, expecting strong shipments of DDR4 to drive further gains in the latter half of 2024. In the NOR Flash market, supply constraints are emerging as Chinese manufacturers shift focus to logic wafers, tightening NOR availability and potentially leading to a supply shortage by 2025. Similarly, Winbond anticipates high demand for NAND Flash, projecting tight supply dynamics next year.

Winbond’s production is set to advance, with NOR Flash moving to a 45nm process and new SLC NAND Flash products...

Content: Bigger models, larger clusters fuel AI-server growth
The race to build larger foundational models by hyperscale and tier-2 cloud and sovereigns is fueling sustained AI-server sales momentum into 2025, which is set to grow 55% to $163 million, according to 650 Group. Nvidia's Blackwell product cycle is a sales tailwind, leading to server racks valued at up to $3-$4 million apiece vs. $1.5-$3 million for fully loaded racks in the Hopper cycle. Hyperscale and tier-2 cloud providers could begin deploying AI-server clusters with as many as 100,000 GPUs, with some reaching 200,000. This could lead to more and bigger deals.
Enterprise customers may start adding to growth as they roll out and ramp up in-house AI. Enterprise is likely to make up 36% of industry sales ($23 billion) in 2025, 650 Group estimates show.

To understand this, let’s take a closer look at the hyperscale segment and one of the company’s main differentiators in the area—its ODM+ strategy.\n\n**What is “hyperscale”?**When we talk about “hyperscale,” we’re mostly talking about the largest cloud giants like Google, Baidu, Amazon, and Microsoft, and some tier 2 hyperscale players like Twitter or carriers like AT&T.

Hyperscale and tier-2 cloud providers could begin deploying AI-server clusters with as many as 100,000 GPUs, with some reaching 200,000. This could lead to more and bigger deals.\nEnterprise customers may start adding to growth as they roll out and ramp up in-house AI.

IGCC  •  MERICS  •  April 2024
Huawei is Quietly Dominating China’s Semiconductor Supply Chain
Key Findings
• Huawei is emerging as the leader of 
a national team in semiconductors. It 
dominates the supply chain, particularly  
in chip manufacturing. 
• Huawei is transforming from a 
telecommunications national champion  
to a company that oversees the complete 
value chain for semiconductors. This comes 
as a result of both Chinese government 
support and U.S. government restrictions. 
• Huawei is quietly expanding its presence 
across the supply chain, including in 
lithography, a key chokepoint for China’s 
semiconductor progress. As “team lead,”  
Huawei often performs the role of 
integrator, becoming more-and-more  
like its competitor Samsung, a large  
South Korean conglomerate. 
• The new Huawei Mate 60 Pro phone, 
released in September 2023, exemplifies 
Huawei’s success in supply chain integration.  
The phone’s use of advanced chips—which 
U.S. restrictions had sought to prevent—
demonstrates h...

Content: Years after the US first imposed trade restrictions against Huawei, the government’s strategy to restrain the Chinese technology company remains unclear. By mid-2019, after months of US pressure and restrictions, Huawei found its supply chain for computer parts and software under siege, so it has actively pushed forward the localisation of its supply chain, continually increasing the domestic substitution rate of phone components. Before restrictions, Huawei relied heavily on companies like Intel, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and TSMC. Post-restrictions, Huawei has increased partnerships with domestic Chinese suppliers like SMIC for semiconductors and BOE Technology for displays. By 2023, the Mate 60 series achieved a domestic substitution rate of 90% of components and circuit boards to overcome the US restrictions. In December 2024, Huawei officially unveiled its Mate 70 series, the latest flagship smartphone for the Chinese market.

Summary
Huawei is emerging as the leader of China’s national team in semiconductors, 
dominating chip manufacturing and seeking to integrate the country’s entire supply 
chain. Its ambitions stem from both its placement on the U.S. Entity List and strong 
government support at the national and local level. Internationally, Huawei is coy 
about these ambitions, hiding its supply chain involvement and often operating 
under a different company’s name. Meanwhile, Huawei’s experience is also 
encouraging other Chinese technology companies to support China’s quest for 
chip self-sufficiency, developing new hardware and software for that purpose. The 
clandestine nature of Huawei’s involvement—it is not known who serves what role 
in semiconductor production—makes it more difficult for Western companies and 
governments to assess China’s progress in technology, vet potential partners and 
customers, and conduct risk assessments.

Content: Years after the US first imposed trade restrictions against Huawei, the government’s strategy to restrain the Chinese technology company remains unclear. By mid-2019, after months of US pressure and restrictions, Huawei found its supply chain for computer parts and software under siege, so it has actively pushed forward the localisation of its supply chain, continually increasing the domestic substitution rate of phone components. Before restrictions, Huawei relied heavily on companies like Intel, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and TSMC. Post-restrictions, Huawei has increased partnerships with domestic Chinese suppliers like SMIC for semiconductors and BOE Technology for displays. By 2023, the Mate 60 series achieved a domestic substitution rate of 90% of components and circuit boards to overcome the US restrictions. In December 2024, Huawei officially unveiled its Mate 70 series, the latest flagship smartphone for the Chinese market.

5 companies in Huawei's semiconductor network
A semiconductor company owned by Huawei for China's semiconductor independence. 
Ever since the U.S. government blacklisted Huawei, the Chinese tech giant has experienced difficulties procuring almost all kinds of chips, because they all use American technologies in one way or another. And so to avoid curbs imposed by the U.S., Huawei has been building a secret fab network in China that can meet its demand for commodity logic, memory, microcontrollers, and even power semiconductors, according to a presentation by SIA (reported by Bloomberg).
Right now, Huawei's network includes five fabs: 
Shenzhen Pensun Technology's (PST) 28nm/40nm-capable logic fab; 
Fujian Jihnua's (aka Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., JHICC) memory fab that can make commodity DRAMs;

The \nclandestine nature of Huawei’s involvement—it is not known who serves what role \nin semiconductor production—makes it more difficult for Western companies and \ngovernments to assess China’s progress in technology, vet potential partners and \ncustomers, and conduct risk assessments. \nThis brief is part of a special ser...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 8:\nTitle: HiSilicon\nURL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiSilicon\nContent: ### Kirin 950 and 955\n\n• supports – SD 4.1 (UHS-II) / UFS 2.0 / eMMC 5.1 / MU-MIMO 802.11ac Wi-Fi / Bluetooth 4.2 Smart / USB 3.0 / NFS / Dual ISP (42\xa0MP) / Native 10-bit 4K video encode / i5 coprocessor / Tensilica HiFi 4 DSP... ### Kirin 9000S, Kirin 9010, Kirin 9020 series\n\nThe Kirin 9000S, Kirin 9000S1, and Kirin 9010 of the Kirin 9000 Hi36A0 family are the first HiSilicon-developed SoCs manufactured in high volumes in mainland China by SMIC. The SoC had its debut with the Huawei Mate 60 in late 2023 with the Kirin 9000S alongside overclocked enhancements of the Kirin 9000S1 and Kirin 9010 with the Huawei Pura 70 series in early 2024. According to Tom\'s Hardware, the Taishan V120 core, developed by HiSilicon, was roughly on par with AMD\'s Zen 3 cores from late 2020. Four of these cores were used in the 9000 series alongside four efficiency-focused Arm Cortex-A510 cores. The SoCs are based on SMIC\'s 7nm technology node, referred to as "N+2". It also includes 1 Da Vinci "big" NPU core and 1 Da Vinci "small"...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'}

(The first was a smaller prototype unveiled by RIKEN in March 2023.) The 64-qubit system at the RIKEN-Fujitsu center demonstrated Fujitsu’s ability to design and operate a medium-scale superconducting processor. It was made available via a cloud-based hybrid quantum computing platform that integrates the quantum processor with a powerful simulator, allowing selected enterprises and research institutions to experiment with quantum algorithms from late 2023 onward. This hybrid platform approach – combining a real 64-qubit device with a Fugaku-derived simulator – was aimed at fostering early application development in fields like materials science, finance, and drug discovery while the hardware scales up.

Content: One driver of industry sales has been the demand for gen AI chips: a mix of CPUs, GPUs, data center communications chips, memory, power chips, and more. Deloitte’s 2024 TMT Predictions report predicted that those gen AI chips collectively would be worth “more than” US$50 billion,

7 which was a much too conservative forecast, as the market was likely worth over US$125 billion in 2024—and represented over 20% of total chip sales for the year. 8 At the time of publication, we predict that gen AI chips will be over US$150 billion in 2025. 9 Further, Lisa Su, chief executive officer at AMD, moved her estimate for the total addressable market for AI accelerator chips up to US$500 billion in 2028—a number larger than sales for the entire chip industry in 2023. 10

Title: Semiconductor industry - Wikipedia
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_company
Content: Today, much of the industry is based on the foundry model, which consists of semiconductor fabrication plants (foundries) and integrated circuit design operations, each belonging to separate companies or subsidiaries. Some companies, known as integrated device manufacturers, both design and manufacture semiconductors. The foundry model has resulted in consolidation among foundries. As of 2021, only three firms are able to manufacture the most advanced semiconductors: TSMC of Taiwan, Samsung of South Korea, and Intel of the United States. Part of this is due to the high capital costs of building foundries. TSMC's latest factory, capable of fabricating 3 nm process semiconductors and completed in 2020, cost $19.5 billion.

Intel is considering outsourcing some production to TSMC. It currently can only produce 10 nm semiconductors, while TSMC and Samsung can both produce 5 nm. GlobalFoundries, an American-headquartered firm, uses a 12 nm process for its most advanced chips due to the rapidly increasing developme...

**Tokyo, December 26, 2023**

Earlier this year Fujitsu announced its vision for 2030 under a new Mid-term Management Plan, underlining its ambition to transform into “a technology company that realizes net positive outcomes for its stakeholders including society, customers, shareholders and employees, while providing digital services which contribute to sustainability across industries.”

The three years until 2025 represent a critical period for the realization of this vision, during which Fujitsu will position itself for sustainable growth and improved profitability and embark on a comprehensive transformation of its business model and portfolio.

Now, the sale would not be permitted because they may be “used for military purposes,” said China’s Commerce Ministry.... Ever since the debut of ChatGPT, AI has been growing at an explosive pace, resulting in new waves of innovation. This meteoric demand led chip manufacturers to look for different ways to improve the performance and efficiency of their components for the betterment of AI applications. Explorations into other manufacturing processes reveal new capabilities left unexplored due to lack of demand and high cost.

However, AI’s growth might hit a snag soon as the data center industry, the sector powering these new applications, runs out of space and available power.

Content: Today, much of the industry is based on the foundry model, which consists of semiconductor fabrication plants (foundries) and integrated circuit design operations, each belonging to separate companies or subsidiaries. Some companies, known as integrated device manufacturers, both design and manufacture semiconductors. The foundry model has resulted in consolidation among foundries. As of 2021, only three firms are able to manufacture the most advanced semiconductors: TSMC of Taiwan, Samsung of South Korea, and Intel of the United States. Part of this is due to the high capital costs of building foundries. TSMC's latest factory, capable of fabricating 3 nm process semiconductors and completed in 2020, cost $19.5 billion.

Intel is considering outsourcing some production to TSMC. It currently can only produce 10 nm semiconductors, while TSMC and Samsung can both produce 5 nm. GlobalFoundries, an American-headquartered firm, uses a 12 nm process for its most advanced chips due to the rapidly increasing developme...

Content: One driver of industry sales has been the demand for gen AI chips: a mix of CPUs, GPUs, data center communications chips, memory, power chips, and more. Deloitte’s 2024 TMT Predictions report predicted that those gen AI chips collectively would be worth “more than” US$50 billion,

7 which was a much too conservative forecast, as the market was likely worth over US$125 billion in 2024—and represented over 20% of total chip sales for the year. 8 At the time of publication, we predict that gen AI chips will be over US$150 billion in 2025. 9 Further, Lisa Su, chief executive officer at AMD, moved her estimate for the total addressable market for AI accelerator chips up to US$500 billion in 2028—a number larger than sales for the entire chip industry in 2023. 10

In terms of end markets, after being flat at around 262 million units over 2023 and in 2024, PC sales are expected to grow in 2025 by over 4% to about 273 million units.

Deloitte’s 2024 TMT Predictions report predicted that those gen AI chips collectively would be worth “more than” US$50 billion,\n\n7 which was a much too conservative forecast, as the market was likely worth over US$125 billion in 2024—and represented over 20% of total chip sales for the year. 8 At the time of publication, we predict that gen AI chips will be over US$150 billion in 2025. 9 Further, Lisa Su, chief executive officer at AMD, moved her estimate for the total addressable market for AI accelerator chips up to US$500 billion in 2028—a number larger than sales for the entire chip industry in 2023. 10\n\nIn terms of end markets, after being flat at around 262 million units over 2023 and in 2024, PC sales are expected to grow in 2025 by over 4% to about 273 million units.\n\n11 Meanwhile, smartphone sales are expected to grow at low single digits in 2025 (an...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}

TSMC leadership also expressed this opinion in late 2024, stating that AI will contribute to sales over the next year. Since late 2022, AI has been an extremely popular topic within the semiconductor industry and a primary growth driver despite the poor market performance across many markets.

Foxconn’s positive revenue report was also strong despite low performances in computing products and smart electronics, which experienced declines. Foxconn, a well-known supplier of tech behemoth Apple, stated that it saw “slight declines” in its computing and smart consumer electronics areas during Q4. Still, it wasn’t enough to derail its overall growth.

Content: Today, much of the industry is based on the foundry model, which consists of semiconductor fabrication plants (foundries) and integrated circuit design operations, each belonging to separate companies or subsidiaries. Some companies, known as integrated device manufacturers, both design and manufacture semiconductors. The foundry model has resulted in consolidation among foundries. As of 2021, only three firms are able to manufacture the most advanced semiconductors: TSMC of Taiwan, Samsung of South Korea, and Intel of the United States. Part of this is due to the high capital costs of building foundries. TSMC's latest factory, capable of fabricating 3 nm process semiconductors and completed in 2020, cost $19.5 billion.

Intel is considering outsourcing some production to TSMC. It currently can only produce 10 nm semiconductors, while TSMC and Samsung can both produce 5 nm. GlobalFoundries, an American-headquartered firm, uses a 12 nm process for its most advanced chips due to the rapidly increasing developme...

SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY AT A TURNING POINT 
― THE TECHNOLOGY AND VALUE CHAIN SUPPORTING THE GROWTH OF 
GENERATIVE AI ―  
 
Reina Ogawa 
Technology & Innovation Studies Div., Industry Innovation Dept. 
Mitsui & Co. Global Strategic Studies Institute 
 
SUMMARY 
⚫ 
The functions of semiconductors can be compared to human office work: logic corresponds to the person, 
memory to a desk, and storage to a bookshelf. Within DRAM, the most common type of memory, market 
growth is being driven by high bandwidth memory (HBM) for generative AI, with the HBM market projected 
to reach USD 44 billion by 2029. 
⚫ 
Memory is considered a bottleneck in AI development. In the next generation of HBM, part of the 
manufacturing process is expected to be outsourced to logic foundries. 
⚫ 
Changes in the value chain starting with next-generation HBM are expected to expand the range of 
suppliers for elemental technologies and create new business models.

■Summary
➢Business report for FY 2024/1
・Sales increased because of firm demand for motor cores for electric vehicles while profits decreased 
because of weaker demand for leadframe resulting from prolonged inventory adjustment of semiconductors.
・The Electrical parts business increased sales and profits because of the contribution of increased orders for 
existing products and the start of mass production of new products resulting from the production recovery of 
auto manufacturers due to the resolved shortage of semiconductors to be purchased.
・The Electronic parts business decreased sales and profits because of the effect of decreased orders 
resulting from prolonged inventory adjustment of semiconductors.
➢Earnings forecast for FY 2025/1

Content: **Mitsui High-tec, Inc.** (Japanese: 株式会社三井ハイテック) is a Japanese manufacturer of precision dies, motor cores for traction motors, and lead frames, based in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka Prefecture. Founded in 1949 as a manufacturer of stamping dies, the company expanded rapidly following its development of a stamping process for IC lead frame production. It is currently a major global supplier of the laminated motor cores used in hybrid and electric vehicles, with local subsidiaries in the Chinese, North American, and European markets. The company is not affiliated with the Mitsui Group; it is named for its founder, Yoshiaki Mitsui.... Requiring new facilities to accommodate the growth of its lead frame business, Mitsui expanded its Komine plant in 1982. IC-related production grew to comprise more than 70% of Mitsui's total output; in recognition of this, Mitsui Manufacturing was renamed "Mitsui High-tec" on 8 May 1984. It was listed on the Fukuoka Stock Exchange on 3 September 1984.

Content: At Mitsui High-tec, we reject easy, cost-based rationalizations for price increases. And we do not condone dumping tactics for building or clinging onto market share. Neither approach is in the long-term interests of any company or its customers. The only sure formula for corporate vitality is to furnish customers with the quantity and quality of goods they require, when they need them, and at prices they can afford. This simple formula is anything but easy to implement, demanding strong, yet flexible, management and a genuine commitment to technological innovation. We believe that our 50 years of phenomenal growth evidence the validity of our premise. Putting sound principles into practice has enabled us to increase sales volume dramatically, and we fully intend to sustain similar progress in the years ahead. Technological refinements and innovations have earned business for Mitsui High-tec by minimizing product prices while maximizing quality and performance. Sophisticated engineering, however, is no longer...

Introduction
Leadframes are thin metal strips used as internal wiring in semiconductor packages that 
serve as a bridge to external wiring. Leadframes are used in most semiconductor packages. 
In a world first, Mitsui High-tec has enabled the production of these leadframes with 
a stamping process that uses precision toolings. In addition to stamping, the Company cur­
rently produces leadframes through an etching process that uses photographic technology. 
 In the semiconductor industry, demands have been expanding for automotive semiconductors 
as well as semiconductors for 5G applications and information communications equipment. 
The Company leverages its global supply structure to facilitate production in optimal 
­
locations in order to fulfill growing demand alongside progress in the electrification of ...

■Summary
➢Business report for FY 2024/1
・Sales increased because of firm demand for motor cores for electric vehicles while profits decreased 
because of weaker demand for leadframe resulting from prolonged inventory adjustment of semiconductors.
・The Electrical parts business increased sales and profits because of the contribution of increased orders for 
existing products and the start of mass production of new products resulting from the production recovery of 
auto manufacturers due to the resolved shortage of semiconductors to be purchased.
・The Electronic parts business decreased sales and profits because of the effect of decreased orders 
resulting from prolonged inventory adjustment of semiconductors.
➢Earnings forecast for FY 2025/1
・For FY 2025/1, the Company expects increasing sales and profits with net sales of JPY 237 billion and

Content: **Mitsui High-tec, Inc.** (Japanese: 株式会社三井ハイテック) is a Japanese manufacturer of precision dies, motor cores for traction motors, and lead frames, based in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka Prefecture. Founded in 1949 as a manufacturer of stamping dies, the company expanded rapidly following its development of a stamping process for IC lead frame production. It is currently a major global supplier of the laminated motor cores used in hybrid and electric vehicles, with local subsidiaries in the Chinese, North American, and European markets. The company is not affiliated with the Mitsui Group; it is named for its founder, Yoshiaki Mitsui.... ## History

The company was established as "Mitsui Manufacturing" (Japanese: 三井工作所) by Yoshiaki Mitsui on 12 January 1949. Mitsui, who had previously worked as a die operator at the Yaskawa Electric Corporation, decided to start his own tool and die company with two former colleagues from Yaskawa. The company's first workshop, which was located in the Kurosaki section of Yahata City (now ...

### Leadframe

A leadframe is a thin layer of metal that connects the wiring from tiny electrical terminals on the semiconductor surface to the large-scale circuitry on electrical devices and circuit boards. Leadframes are used in almost all semiconductor packages.

Mitsui High-tec accomplished the production of IC leadframes by precision-die-stamping for the first time in the world and, at present, we are producing leadframes not only by stamping but also by chemical etching.

### Motor Core

Mitsui High-tec provides high quality and low cost motor core products with complete global service from die design, fabrication and stamping manufacturing.

Proven technology accumulated since our company foundation guarantees high quality and low cost for precision stamping dies and the MAC system which was developed in-house. MAC is a system that fuses motor core layers to complete each core product inside the stamping tool as they are stamped, eliminating the need for a separate process after stamping.
