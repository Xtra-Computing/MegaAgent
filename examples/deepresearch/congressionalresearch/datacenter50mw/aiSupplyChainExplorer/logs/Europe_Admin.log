Content: #### Cloud GPUs

Thanks to the strength of its datacenter offering, NVIDIA almost has a monopoly on the cloud AI market, with most cloud players offering only NVIDIA GPUs as cloud GPUs.

NVIDIA also launched its DGX Cloud offering, providing cloud GPU infrastructure directly to enterprises, bypassing cloud providers.

#### GPUs for graphics

Xbox uses a chipset codeveloped by NVIDIA and Microsoft. NVIDIA’s GPUs for retail users include the GeForce series.... ### 3. Intel

Intel is the most significant player in the CPU market and has a long history of semiconductor development. Unlike NVIDIA and AMD, Intel uses its own foundry to build its chips.

Gaudi3 is the latest AI accelerator processor from Intel.

21 However, Intel’s sales guidance for Gaudi3 was ~$500M for 2024, which is significantly lower compared to the billions that AMD is projecting to earn in 2024.

Title: 2025 global semiconductor industry outlook - Deloitte
URL: https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-telecom-outlooks/semiconductor-industry-outlook.html
Content: The semiconductor industry had a robust 2024, with expected double-digit (19%) growth, and sales of US$627 billion for the year.

1 But that’s even better than the earlier forecast of US$611 billion. 2 And 2025 could be even better, with predicted sales of US$697 billion, 3 reaching a new all-time high, and well on track to reach the widely accepted aspirational goal of US$1 trillion in chip sales by 2030. This suggests the industry only needs to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.5% between 2025 and 2030 (figure 1). 4 Assuming the industry continues to grow at that rate, it could reach US$2 trillion in 2040.

The stock market is often a leading indicator of industry performance: As of mid-December 2024, the combined market capitalization of the top 10 global chip companies was US$6.5 trillion—up 93% from US$3.4 trillion in mid-December 2023 and 235% higher than the US$1.9 trillion seen in mid-November 2022.

The hottest commodity in tech

Last updated: 4 Jan 2024

## Market 101

Tiny bits of silicon are suddenly very big news. Chips are our most important bit of hardware, essential for the energy transition — they go into electric vehicles and wind turbines — for AI tools and sophisticated military tech. They’re key to the digitalisation of… well, everything.

Advanced chipmaking equipment is a hidden European strength, notwithstanding Silicon Valley-based NVIDIA’s near total lock on specialised chips to power AI products. European success stories include the region’s most valuable technology company, Eindhoven-based ASML, which holds a global monopoly on extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, and Germany’s Carl Zeiss SMT, the only manufacturer of the mirrors and lenses used in the world’s most advanced chipmaking equipment. But there are strategic holes in the region too — and this is worrying leaders.

Everyone knows Samsung, in fact it may be the most publicly recognizable name brand on this list (even more so than Nvidia). Samsung is known globally for its consumer electronics from phones to laptops to TVs.

But fewer people know that Samsung also operates one of the largest semiconductor manufacturing divisions on the planet. The company is pivotal in memory chip technology and is expanding its foundry services, aiming to rival TSMC with significant investments in fabrication plants and R&D. If successful, this would be a huge value proposition on top of its already-robust portfolio in the value chain.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a major reason behind the stellar success stories of several tech giants over the past year. Despite recent volatility in tech stocks, the massive investments pouring into AI underscore the unwavering optimism about its potential.

In fact, in a recent note, BofA Securities analysts forecast that generative AI could transform corporate efficiency, with widespread adoption anticipated by 2025. As AI pilots transition to production for “44% of S&P companies that mentioned AI” during fiscal 2024 Q2 earnings, this shift could enhance operating margins by 200 basis points over the next five years, potentially yielding a staggering $55 billion in annual cost savings.

## Computer memory

Computer memory refers to the physical devices which are used to store data or programs for use in a computer. Primary storage allows for the short-term storage of data: information is retained for immediate use and is directly accessible by the CPU, usually until the main device is reset or turned off. Secondary storage, either in the form of hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), flash drives, or other longer-term storage devices, record and hold data indefinitely, even when the main device is unpowered.... ## HDD and SSD

HDDs and SSDs are both a form of non-volatile memory commonly used for secondary storage in laptops and computers. HDDs are considered to be an old-school storage device, made up of magnetic tape and with mechanical parts inside. A solid-state...

Content: ## AI investment landscape in Europe today

According to Pitchbook, European AI companies raised over $13B in 2024 – marking a 22% increase in capital invested, even as deal volume declined by 31% year-over-year. The increase in capital, despite the drop in deal volume, signals a consolidation of funding among established frontrunners across core LLMs, generative AI application layers, AI automation and deep tech. Some of the most active European investors fueling this growth include BPI France, LocalGlobe, Balderton, Index Ventures and Atomico. All have played a significant role in backing AI-driven startups across the region.

The U.K. remains a dominant AI hub, securing nearly $6B in AI funding in 2024—more than France and Germany combined (refer to chart below). However, France is rapidly catching up with Mistral AI emerging as the region’s leading LLM provider after raising over $1B within one year of its founding.

The increase in capital, despite the drop in deal volume, signals a consolidation of funding among established frontrunners across core LLMs, generative AI application layers, AI automation and deep tech. Some of the most active European investors fueling this growth include BPI France, LocalGlobe, Balderton, Index Ventures and Atomico. All have played a significant role in backing AI-driven startups across the region.\n\nThe U.K. remains a dominant AI hub, securing nearly $6B in AI funding in 2024—more than France and Germany combined (refer to chart below). However, France is rapidly catching up with Mistral AI emerging as the region’s leading LLM provider after raising over $1B within one year of its founding.
