Intel is the most significant player in the CPU market and has a long history of semiconductor development. Unlike NVIDIA and AMD, Intel uses its own foundry to build its chips.

Gaudi3 is the latest AI accelerator processor from Intel.

21 However, Intel’s sales guidance for Gaudi3 was ~$500M for 2024, which is significantly lower compared to the billions that AMD is projecting to earn in 2024.

Intel is experiencing governance issues, as shown by its CEO Pat Gelsinger’s departure in December 2024. A significant share of Intel’s board members lack experience in leading a semiconductor company in an operational manner.

22 Following the departure of its CEO, Intel’s strategy in the AI and foundry markets remains unclear.... ## Which cloud AI providers produce their own chips?
