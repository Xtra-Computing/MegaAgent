Title: Data Centers Almost Sole Driver of Nvidia's Revenue Boom
URL: https://www.statista.com/chart/25578/nvidias-quarterly-revenue-by-segments/
Content: After an already successful fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2024, generating a $12 billion net income on revenues of $22 billion between November 2023 and January 2024, chipmaker Nvidia outperformed expectations yet again, beating analyst projections with revenues of $26 billion and a net income of roughly $15 billion for the quarter. As our chart shows, this immense success would have been considered improbable just a year ago and is largely built on one pillar of the company.

This pillar is the data center segment which includes chips manufactured specifically with the AI industry in mind, which heavily relies on cloud computing and the required resource-intensive, high-powered server farms. Between February and April 2024, $22.6 billion or 87 percent of Nvidia's overall revenue was attributable to data center solutions. Some of its other segments also showed considerable relative growth year over year, with gaming and visualization solutions bringing in 18 and 45 percent more, respectively, than in the ...

Title: How Much Data Center Revenue Do AI Companies Bring In?
URL: https://www.fool.com/research/data-center-revenue-ai-companies/
Content: Data centers have become major investments for tech companies looking to capitalize on the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Many of the largest companies in the sector have doubled or tripled their capital expenditures and announced plans to continue spending even more on AI-ready data centers.
The dramatic rise in spending has been a boon to AI companies supplying the graphics processing units (GPUs), servers, and other infrastructure that data centers need. But not every company with a data center division has seen record revenue growth.
We analyzed financial statements of four AI companies: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). Here's how much data center revenue AI companies are bringing in and what to expect in the near future. Data center revenue over time: Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and IBM

Content: AMD’s data center revenue for Q4 2024 missed analysts' expectations, despite being up 69 percent year-on-year (YoY).

Revenue for the segment totaled $3.86 billion for the quarter, a fractional increase on the $3.5bn AMD reported in data center revenue for Q3 2024 and well below analyst’s predictions of $4.14bn.

AMD’s total FY2024 data center revenue increased 94 percent to $12.6bn, of which $5bn was from the sale of its Instinct AI GPUs. As with the previous quarter, the company said the segment growth was primarily driven by growing demand for Instinct and AMD Epyc CPUs.

Overall, AMD posted record fourth-quarter and full-year revenue, with the figures totaling $7.7bn for Q4 and $25.8bn for the full financial year. The company said it expects revenue of $7.1bn in Q1 2025, plus or minus $300 million.

Speaking during an earnings call after the results had been posted, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su said its data center segment contributed roughly 50 percent of the company’s annual revenue, as “Instinct and Epyc proces...

Title: How Much Data Center Revenue Do AI Companies Bring In?
URL: https://www.fool.com/research/data-center-revenue-ai-companies/
Content: Data centers have become major investments for tech companies looking to capitalize on the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Many of the largest companies in the sector have doubled or tripled their capital expenditures and announced plans to continue spending even more on AI-ready data centers.
The dramatic rise in spending has been a boon to AI companies supplying the graphics processing units (GPUs), servers, and other infrastructure that data centers need. But not every company with a data center division has seen record revenue growth.
We analyzed financial statements of four AI companies: Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). Here's how much data center revenue AI companies are bringing in and what to expect in the near future. Data center revenue over time: Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and IBM
Nvidia is the market leader for GPUs, and its revenue numbers reflect that. Its data center division, which supplies GPUs to data ...

**What’s going on here?**

Micron Technology slightly increased its 2024 capital expenditure forecast to around $8 billion, driven by investments in high bandwidth memory (HBM) semiconductors for AI applications.

**What does this mean?**

Micron Technology, based in Boise, Idaho, is one of the top three suppliers of HBM chips, crucial for AI servers. The company’s state-of-the-art HBM3E chips will power Nvidia's H200 chips.

Micron is ramping up production from current eight-layer HBM chips to 12-layer variants. CFO Matt Murphy announced the $8 billion capex forecast, up from an earlier $7.5 billion estimate, emphasizing HBM's potential to be a multibillion-dollar segment by fiscal 2025. Despite this o...

Content: Here are some key quarterly highlights. First, Supermicro is pleased to be included in the NASDAQ 100 Index last quarter. Fiscal Q4 net revenue totaled $5.31 billion, up 143% year-on-year with a strong record high backlog. We could ship more if not for DLC liquid cooling component shortage. Fiscal Q4 non-GAAP earnings of $6.25 per share were well above $3.51 last year, which was 78% year-on-year growth. Our Q4 operating margin is 7.8%, which is lower than what we expected due to the higher mix of hyperscale datacenter business and expedited costs of our DLC liquid cooling components in June and September quarters. Some key new components shortage delayed about $800 million of revenue shipments to July, which lowered our EPS for June and will be recognized in our September quarter.

The availability of our Malaysia facility later this calendar year and our dominating position in DLC liquid cooling total solutions will be instrumental in increasing our profitability. Supermicro is powering the largest AI factor...

Content: Thank you, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. We achieved another record-breaking quarter, with revenue of $3.85 billion, a 200% increase from same time last year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $6.65, up more than 308% year-on-year. Supermicro is at the forefront of the current AI revolution. These strong results reflect the continued demand for our rack-scale plug-and-play total AI solutions. We continue to face some supply chain challenges due to new products that require new key components, especially, DLC-related components, and believe this situation will gradually improve in the coming quarters. To sustain this rapid growth, we are making significant investments in production, operation, management software, cloud features and customer service to further increase our customer base and bring more value to them. To support this scale-up, we raised an additional $3.28 billion through a convertible note and secondary equity offering in the quarter. We like to support strong short- and long-term gro...

Content: And in Q4, reflecting the launch of next-generation devices and our North American customers, we expect wireless revenue to actually grow over 20% sequentially even as it will be relatively flat year-on-year. On to broadband, Q3 revenue declined 49% year-on-year to $557 million, represented 8% of semiconductor revenue. Broadband remains weak on a continued pause in telco and service provider spending. And in Q4, we expect broadband to continue to be down over 40% year-on-year, but we do expect that recovery to begin in ’25. Finally, Q3 industrial resales of $164 million declined 31% year-on-year. We believe we are approaching bottom in Q3 as Q4 resales are expected to recover sequentially. Year-on-year, Q4 industrial resales will still be down approximately 20%.

In summary, here are the trends we are seeing in semiconductors. In aggregate, we have reached bottom in our non-AI markets and we’re expecting a recovery in Q4. AI demand remains strong and we expect, in Q4, AI revenue to grow sequentially 10% to ov...

I will then have Deepak talk more about this in his section and explain this much more eloquently and elaborately. We expect a typical customer entering into a platformization transaction will not pay us for our technology for a period of time. As these programs ramp over the next year, we expect a change to our billings and revenue growth for the next 12 to 18 months. As customers move into the period where contracts have a full billing and revenue contribution, we expect to see an acceleration in our top line metrics. Beyond this dip and acceleration in our top line metrics, we believe we can sustain higher growth rates for longer, driven by sticky and broad platform relationships with incremental customers, allowing us to aspire to a goal of $15 billion in next generation security in 2030.

Content: For the last several weeks, we’ve released the announced product, namely AI Access, the AI Firewall or runtime security, and AI security posture management. We believe this makes us the first to market with a comprehensive portfolio for secure AI by design. Before I hand over the call to Dipak, I want to reflect on our journey and set some context as we discuss fiscal year 2025. Throughout fiscal year 2024, we saw a backdrop helping create interest in demand for enhanced cybersecurity. This helps to accelerate our bookings in the second half of the year. It is also reflected in our new platformization, as we close the year with strong momentum and our strong NGS ARR. FY ’24 marked a seminal moment in our history. I feel our innovation engine is now leading the market, be it by showing enhancements to our SASE portfolio, our cloud security efforts, or in the SoC.

Content: In Q1, the cost of money remained a constant discussion and customers' significant focus on this topic is becoming the new normal. The way it manifests itself in our business is that there's always a payment in duration discussions in final negotiations.

Given our strong balance sheet, we can use a mix of strategies to navigate the environment. This includes annual billing plans, financing through PANFS, and partner financing.

Whilst this does not impact our business demand or the impact to annual revenue or annual metrics, it does create variability on total billings more than before depending on financing used or the duration of contracts. I'm not concerned about the demand for cyber security, for this quarter and upcoming quarters, though my concern about our ability to execute, the billings variability is a pure consequence of the payment conversation that we're having with our customers and this is validated by the fact that we continue to see strong RPO and low churn suggesting this is a cosmetic impa...

As customers move into the period where contracts have a full billing and revenue contribution, we expect to see an acceleration in our top line metrics.

**Anil Singhal:** Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you for all for joining us today. In fiscal year 2024, strong cybersecurity revenue growth was a highlight for NetScout as customers continue to prioritize cybersecurity spending amidst heightened geopolitical tensions and expanding cyber threat landscape. This strength was more than offset by the constrained customer spending environment, affecting our service assurance offerings, primarily related to our domestic service provider or customers. Despite the top line headwinds, our diligent cost containment actions and flexible cost structure contributed to non-GAAP earnings per share growth year-over-year.
