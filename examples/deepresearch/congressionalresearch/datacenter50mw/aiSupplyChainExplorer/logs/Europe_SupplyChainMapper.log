ASML designs, assembles and sells machines used in the semiconductor (chip) manufacturing process.

The core part of ASML’s business is selling lithography machines & other systems equipment. The remaining services part, c.20% of sales, relates to maintenance, customer support & upgrades.

The service’s business is subscription-like and given that 95% of lithography machines are still in service, maintenance & repair represents a 20+ year annuity.

Content: # 6 ingredients of a robust supply chain

At ASML, we don’t innovate in isolation. Our supply chain is crucial to our success and we’ve always relied on our suppliers to manufacture many of the components that go into our lithography systems. In fact, about 80% of the bill of materials of our machines is manufactured by our suppliers. That means we can focus on architecting and integrating the most advanced chip equipment in the world, pushing technology to new limits.

Our rapid growth over the past few years and the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic stretched global supply chains to their limits have highlighted just how important it is to work closely with suppliers around the world. That’s why we prioritize nurturing and growing those relationships. By partnering closely with and supporting our suppliers, we’re ensuring that they’re prepared to work with us for years to come – and to weather the changes that the chip industry is known for, including periods of rapid growth and business-cycle fluctuation...

## Introduction

ASML Holding is the world’s leading supplier of photolithography systems, critical for manufacturing semiconductor chips (brief.bismarckanalysis.com). It is the sole provider of cutting-edge extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines and a dominant player in deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography. In April 2025, the United States expanded tariffs affecting semiconductor equipment imports, introducing new complexities for ASML and its customers amid an evolving geopolitical landscape. This report presents a forensic analysis of ASML’s supply chain and a scenario-based assessment of how the April 2025 U.S. tariff expansion – alongside Chinese retaliatory moves and Dutch export controls – could impact ASML’s EUV (NXE series) and DUV (TWINSCAN/NXT series) business. We examine ASML’s multi-tier supplier network with country-of-origin mapping, the geographic distribution of its end markets (U.S., South Korea, Taiwan, China, Japan), and the potential eff...

### Managing the cycle, preparing for greater growth in years to come

President, Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board of Management, Peter Wennink.

Despite macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, ASML has again delivered strong performance in 2023. We have grown sales by 30% to €27.6 billion and lifted our gross margin to 51.3%. We returned €3.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. At the end of 2023, we finished with a backlog of €39.0 billion and we anticipate that with our sustained focus on technology innovation, we will continue to break new ground – not only in terms of technological development, but also in how we manage the environmental impact of our products and services.

This stellar performance has been achieved against a backdrop of what turned out to be a real downturn in the semiconductor industry instead of the m...

## Introduction

ASML Holding is the world’s leading supplier of photolithography systems, critical for manufacturing semiconductor chips (brief.bismarckanalysis.com). It is the sole provider of cutting-edge extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines and a dominant player in deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography. In April 2025, the United States expanded tariffs affecting semiconductor equipment imports, introducing new complexities for ASML and its customers amid an evolving geopolitical landscape. This report presents a forensic analysis of ASML’s supply chain and a scenario-based assessment of how the April 2025 U.S. tariff expansion – alongside Chinese retaliatory moves and Dutch export controls – could impact ASML’s EUV (NXE series) and DUV (TWINSCAN/NXT series) business. We examine ASML’s multi-tier supplier network with country-of-origin mapping, the geographic distribution of its end markets (U.S., South Korea, Taiwan, China, Japan), and the potential eff...

Title: Arm Holdings - Wikipedia
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_Holdings
Content: **Arm Holdings plc** (formerly an acronym for Advanced RISC Machines and originally Acorn RISC Machine) is a British semiconductor and software design company based in Cambridge, England, whose primary business is the design of central processing unit (CPU) cores that implement the ARM architecture family of instruction sets. It also designs other chips, provides software development tools under the DS-5, RealView and Keil brands, and provides systems and platforms, system-on-a-chip (SoC) infrastructure and software. As a "holding" company, it also holds shares of other companies. Since 2016, it has been majority owned by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group.

While ARM CPUs first appeared in the Acorn Archimedes, a desktop computer, today's systems include mostly embedded systems, including ARM CPUs used in virtually all modern smartphones. Processors based on designs licensed from Arm, or designed by licensees of one of the ARM instruction set architectures, are used in all classes of computing devices. Arm...

Content: # Arm Holdings’ AI Strategy Executive Summary

This report assesses the proposition that Arm Holdings is positioned to dominate the Artificial Intelligence (AI) semiconductor landscape. The analysis concludes that while “dominance” is a strong term in a competitive market, Arm’s unique business model, pervasive ecosystem, and architectural advantages in power efficiency and scalability provide a powerful, multi-pronged foundation to become the most ubiquitous and influential compute platform in the AI era, spanning from massive datacenters to the smallest edge devices.

## Arm’s path to potential dominance rests on four key pillars:

**The Ecosystem Flywheel:**

A virtuous cycle where its intellectual property (IP) licensing model fosters a vast partner and developer ecosystem, which in turn drives widespread adoption and creates a formidable strategic moat.

**Architectural Superiority for AI:**

The inherent performance-per-watt efficiency of its Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture, which ...

Content: It takes Arm’s customers time to develop the complex chips that contain Arm technology. Licenses signed today are not expected to yield royalty revenue for at least 2–3 years. However, if the chips are commercially successful, they can bring additional royalty revenue streams that could last for years, and even decades, to come.

After several years of accelerated investments, in fiscal 2023 Arm saw record revenue growing 13.6% year on year (U.S. dollar–based) as its latest products came to market.

Arm’s license and other revenue in fiscal 2023 grew 38.5% year on year as leading technology companies aligned their future roadmaps with Arm’s product portfolio, many signing long-term, high-value Arm Total Access agreements. This demand has been accelerated by the need for energy-efficient AI capability across a wide range of end markets, from servers to smartphones to sensors, which only Arm’s technology can provide.

Arm’s royalty revenue in fiscal 2023 was down slightly year on year as a decline in the number...

Content: # The Arm Blueprint: A Foundation of Pervasiveness and Partnership

To understand Arm’s formidable position in the burgeoning AI landscape, one must first analyze the foundational business model that has defined its operations for over three decades. Unlike traditional semiconductor companies, Arm Holdings operates not as a manufacturer but as the world’s preeminent architect of semiconductor IP.

1 This unique approach, centered on licensing and partnership, has cultivated a pervasive ecosystem that now serves as the launchpad for its strategic ambitions in artificial intelligence.... # The IP Licensing Model: A Paradigm of “Co-opetition” and Scale

At its core, Arm’s business model is elegantly simple and capital-light: it designs processor architectures and related IP, then licenses these blueprints to other companies.

Content: # Arm Holdings: Assessing the AI-Driven Growth Story vs. Overvalued RealitiesWritten byEli Grant

- Arm Holdings leverages AI-driven growth through energy-efficient chip licensing, with 43.7% of 2025 revenue from AI-related deals.

- Strategic partnerships with AWS, Google, and Microsoft accelerate data center adoption, targeting 50% CPU market share by 2025.

- Sky-high valuation (P/E 200.14) raises risks from regulatory scrutiny, RISC-V competition, and China's geopolitical uncertainties.

- Long-term AI infrastructure potential exists, but investors must balance Arm's IP dominance against supply constraints and margin pressures.

In the high-stakes arena of tech investing, few stories have captured the imagination—and wallets—of investors quite likeArm Holdings. The company, long a quiet titan in semiconductor IP licensing, has surged into the spotlight as a key player in the AI revolution. But as its valuation balloons to stratospheric levels, a critical question emerges: Is Arm's dominance in AI-driven c...

Content: Note the below graphic from ARM’s SEC filings. The cost of semiconductor design continues to increase with advances and increased complexity. In their filing, the company says that the design cost of a 7nm chip is $249M. But the design cost for a 2nm chip is $725M.

Last point.

ARM is basically in the IP licensing business, so they have a nice asset-lite business model. For revenue, they get an upfront licensing fee by companies using their ISA in the design of semiconductors. And then they get royalty fees for every semiconductor that actually gets produced. Unsurprisingly, their financials are pretty fantastic. It’s basically a cash machine.

Note the below revenue stack over time. Notice how much of their revenue is coming from sales made a decade ago.

Here is their income statement.

- Revenue is significant but not huge at $2.6B annually. They are a small percent of the overall spend on CPUs. That is great (as will be discussed).

Content: The French government has launched a new bid to acquire part of Atos, offering €500 million ($525m) for the IT vendor’s HPC, quantum, and artificial intelligence activities.

Details of the non-binding offer for what is referred to as Atos’s “advanced computing” business were revealed on Monday, with the French government having entered into an exclusivity period that runs until May 31, 2025.

If the deal goes ahead, the advanced computing operations will be carved out of the Atos BDS business unit, which also oversees the company’s cybersecurity and big data offerings.

Advanced computing employs 2,500 people and generated an income of €570 million ($599m) in 2023, Atos said. If a deal is reached by May 31, a share purchase agreement will be signed, entitling Atos to an up-front payment of €150 million ($157m).

The potential sale of the advanced computing business, which also includes Atos business computing, was included in the company’s financial rescue package, agreed earlier this year. This is designed ...

Content: ## Atos Group
##### Jul 28, 2020

Content: Despite these challenges, the increased accessibility and efficacy of machine learning (ML) continues to encourage AI supply chains’ permeating ubiquity; such networks have grown common, complex, and diverse, expanding the number of contributors affecting downstream inference tasks (Griesch et al., 2023), often with little documentation or disclosure of their upstream or downstream dependencies. While a simple AI supply chain may include only a base model (e.g., GPT-3 or ResNet-152) and domain-specific data (e.g., for properties of organic molecules (Xie et al., 2024)), AI supply chains now encompass multiple firms interfacing with the broader AI ecosystem and data capture, or directly with end-users, as in the case of Salesforce, Google, and Microsoft’s recent integration of AI across platforms.

**Microsoft**, **Apple**, **Nvidia**, **Amazon**, **Alphabet**, **Meta Platforms**, and **Tesla**, the "Magnificent Seven" may be the most important stocks of this generation. After collectively rising 107% in 2023 -- and another 14% so far in 2024 -- each of these businesses now hold market capitalizations between $600 billion and $3.1 trillion.

To put this size in context, these stocks now account for roughly 30% of the

**S&P 500** index's total market cap of $44.5 trillion. Home to many bleeding-edge technologies in today's world, it is tough to argue that the Magnificent Seven doesn't deserve this massive allocation of funds.

URL: https://middletonenterprises.com/investment-insights-asml-2/
Content: We recently revisited our review of ASML. In the below note, we’ll discuss the reasons why we view ASML as an exceptional business.

ASML designs, assembles and sells machines used in the semiconductor (chip) manufacturing process.

The core part of ASML’s business is selling lithography machines & other systems equipment. The remaining services part, c.20% of sales, relates to maintenance, customer support & upgrades.

The service’s business is subscription-like and given that 95% of lithography machines are still in service, maintenance & repair represents a 20+ year annuity.

[Source: ASML]

Key customers for ASML include TSMC, Samsung & Intel. They use ASML’s machines to manufacture chips which are subsequently assembled & packaged into smartphones, PCs, servers & other products.

Chairman of the Management Board and Chief 
Executive Officer
Despite mixed market conditions, ASM delivered 
a strong performance in 2024. Sales increased 
by 12% at constant currencies, marking our 
eighth consecutive year of double-digit growth, 
and we continued to strengthen our 
engagements with key customers. I want to 
thank all our people for their relentless 
commitment and teamwork, which contributed to 
another successful year for ASM. 
It was a year of progress for the company. To stay ahead 
of what's next, we continued investing in R&D, our 
people, and expansion. We increased our share of wallet 
with leading customers as they prepare to introduce new 
technologies, especially the new gate-all-around (GAA) 
tech node in the advanced logic/foundry segment. 
I believe there's never been a better time to be in the 
semiconductor industry. Market research firms expect 
the semiconductor market to grow to US$1 trillion by the 
end of the decade. Artificial intelligence ...

Title: Arm Holdings - Wikipedia
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arm_Holdings
Content: **Arm Holdings plc** (formerly an acronym for Advanced RISC Machines and originally Acorn RISC Machine) is a British semiconductor and software design company based in Cambridge, England, whose primary business is the design of central processing unit (CPU) cores that implement the ARM architecture family of instruction sets. It also designs other chips, provides software development tools under the DS-5, RealView and Keil brands, and provides systems and platforms, system-on-a-chip (SoC) infrastructure and software. As a "holding" company, it also holds shares of other companies. Since 2016, it has been majority owned by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group.

Title: ARM Processors and ARM Holdings: A Revolutionary ...
URL: https://polyelectronics.us/arm-processors-and-arm-holdings-a-revolutionary-business-model/
Content: ARM processors are at the heart of modern computing, powering everything from smartphones and tablets to embedded systems and data centers. Unlike traditional semiconductor companies that manufacture their own chips, ARM Holdings follows a unique business model centered around designing processor architectures and licensing them to other companies. This approach has led to the widespread adoption of ARM technology while benefiting both ARM Holdings and the manufacturers that implement its designs.

**The ARM Business Model: Licensing Over Manufacturing**

ARM Holdings, now a subsidiary of SoftBank Group, does not manufacture its own chips. Instead, it develops processor architectures and licenses these designs to semiconductor manufacturers like Qualcomm, Apple, Samsung, and MediaTek. These companies, known as ARM licensees, integrate ARM’s core designs into their own customized system-on-chip (SoC) solutions.

There are two primary licensing models that ARM Holdings offers:

Unlike traditional semiconductor companies that manufacture their own chips, ARM Holdings follows a unique business model centered around designing processor architectures and licensing them to other companies. This approach has led to the widespread adoption of ARM technology while benefiting both ARM Holdings and the manufacturers that implement its designs.\n\n**The ARM Business Model: Licensing Over Manufacturing**\n\nARM Holdings, now a subsidiary of SoftBank Group, does not manufacture its own chips. Instead, it develops processor architectures and licenses these designs to semiconductor manufacturers like Qualcomm, Apple, Samsung, and MediaTek. These companies, known as ARM licensees, integrate ARM’s core designs into their own customized system-on-chip (SoC) solutions.\n\nThere are two primary licensing models that ARM Holdings offers:\n\n**Processor IP Licensing**: Compa...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 7:\nTitle: Arm Holdings - Wikipedia\nURL: https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=ARM_Holdings\nContent: - **2008**\n- Logipard AB, a public Swedish company spun out of Anoto AB, specialising in graphics processors\n\n- **2011**\n- Obsidian Software Inc., a privately held company that creates processor verification products\n- Prolific, a developer of automated layout optimisation software tools, and the Prolific team will join the ARM physical IP team\n\n- **2013**\n- Internet of Things startup Sensinode\n- Cadence\'s PANTA family of high-resolution display processor and scaling coprocessor IP cores (formerly developed in Evatronix)\n\n- **2014**\n- PolarSSL, a software library implementing the SSL and TLS protocols.

Content: Letter to our 
shareholders
Dear Melexis shareholder,
2024 has been an unusual year for Melexis. I commend the many 
achievements our team has made, but I want to start by 
commenting on our primary end market, the automotive industry. 
Although automotive production and sales remain broadly stable, 
this industry is undergoing profound changes: new legislation, 
technology and consumer preferences continue to result in an 
increasing number of electrified vehicles, with fully electric or 
hybrid powertrains, and electronic content growth making cars 
greener, safer and more comfortable. Melexis' global presence and 
diversified customer base is a real strength in the context of major 
shifts in automotive manufacturing and supply chain management. 
Next to the dynamics in the automotive sector, demand for 
semiconductors started to exceed supply in 2020, leading to an 
extended period of chip shortages and triggering investment in 
additional capacity. We finally exited this period of constrained 
supply dur...

Content: While European carmakers are adapting to the electrification trend, Asia is emerging as a dominant force, with high production and sales volumes, fueled by a growing middle class. Adapting to the expectations of Asian customers, who prioritize speed, cost efficient solutions and specific product requirements, is crucial. In order to do this, we are already actively building strong connections in Asia. The inauguration of our new facility in Malaysia in the summer of 2024 will give us extra impact in the entire region. I would like to commend our colleagues in Kyiv for their outstanding work in very difficult conditions. They delivered a major project for a key customer with excellence. In 2024, they are working on another very important project for another key customer with impressive commitment. We are immensely proud of our people in Ukraine for their resilience and motivation. They inspire us all at Melexis. Embrace the change and capture the opportunities During our Capital Markets Day in November, we pre...

Let’s talk about one of the bigger risks Melexis faces—

**customer concentration**. After half of 2024, their **10 largest customers accounted for 43% of total revenues**, with the **biggest one alone contributing 13%**. That’s a lot of eggs in just a few baskets.

Why does this matter? For starters, it gives those key customers significant

**negotiating power**, potentially limiting Melexis’ ability to raise prices. Even more concerning, if one of these major clients were to hit financial trouble—or worse, go bankrupt—the ripple effect on Melexis could be substantial.

Looking at the bigger picture, the story stays pretty focused: a staggering 90% of Melexis' revenue comes from the automotive world—a famously cyclical industry. When the going is good, automakers pour money into big contracts and ramp up production. But when the economy stumbles, they slam the brakes, cutting back on spending and scaling down operations. We’ve seen this firsthand with Melexis’ 2024 revenue outlook...

I commend the many \nachievements our team has made, but I want to start by \ncommenting on our primary end market, the automotive industry. \nAlthough automotive production and sales remain broadly stable, \nthis industry is undergoing profound changes: new legislation, \ntechnology and consumer preferences continue to result in an \nincreasing number of electrified vehicles, with fully electric or \nhybrid powertrains, and electronic content growth making cars \ngreener, safer and more comfortable. Melexis' global presence and \ndiversified customer base is a real strength in the context of major \nshifts in automotive manufacturing and supply chain management. \nNext to the dynamics in the automotive sector, demand for \nsemiconductors started to exceed supply in 2020, leading to an \nextended period of chip shortages and triggering investment in \nadditional capacity.

The inauguration of our new facility in Malaysia in the summer of 2024 will give us extra impact in the entire region. I would like to commend our colleagues in Kyiv for their outstanding work in very difficult conditions. They delivered a major project for a key customer with excellence.

The firm’s Networks segment has long been its largest, accounting for almost two-thirds of total net sales in 2023. The segment comprises the provision of Radio Access Network (RAN) hardware and services, with a particular focus on Open RAN – a major trend in wireless infrastructure. Open RAN represents a new approach to the construction and maintenance of mobile networks in which operators are not tied to equipment provided by a single manufacturer. In 2023, Ericsson secured a major RAN contract with U.S. network operator AT&T, beating Nordic rival Nokia.

Title: Nokia says it signed 30 private networking deals in Q2
URL: https://www.fierce-network.com/wireless/nokia
Content: **Nokia said it has signed 30 private network contracts in Q2 2024** **Dell'Oro has said that Nokia is the 2nd place private RAN provider, after Huawei** **VP tells us that ports, energy, and manufacturing continue to be strong business areas for Nokia**

Nokia told Fierce this week that it signed 30 new private networking contracts in the second quarter of 2024.

David de Lancellotti, VP of enterprise campus edge business at Nokia jumped on a call with us mid-week to talk about Nokia’s performance in the private networking space. “Thirty in Q2, and roughly 50 — a little more than 50 — in the first half,” he said of contracts signed.

According to analysts at Dell’Oro Group, Nokia is the second largest global radio access network (RAN) supplier in the private network space after leader Huawei, beating Ericsson to the silver medal spot in its April 2024 report. The firm noted in that report that the top three private wireless RAN suppliers — if we exclude the Chinese market — are Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung.

Benoît Coquart, Legrand’s Chief Executive Officer, commented: 
 
“Legrand had an excellent fourth quarter, with organic sales growth of +6.2%, adjusted operating margin of 
20.7%, and free cash flow of €541 million. This quarter concludes in a good way a year 2024, where, despite 
a generally depressed building market in most of our geographies, the Group recorded further growth in 
sales and very good results. 
 
We recently presented our strategic roadmap for 20301, which calls for accelerating sales growth, both in 
our traditional products and in new solutions supporting the energy and digital transition, and 2024 is a 
perfect illustration of our ambitions with, in particular: 
- a very steady stream of acquisitions, with 9 deals announced over the last twelve months, and a very 
active pipeline; 
- stronger positions in datacenters, which now account for around 20% of Group sales (proforma2) and 
grew organically by close to +15% in 2024;

Content: Schneider Electric, the leader in the digital transformation of energy management and automation, has topped the "World's Most Sustainable Companies for 2024" list by Time magazine and Statista. This recognition reflects Schneider Electric's ambitious goals to reduce its own emissions, but also the company’s commitment to helping its customers to become more energy efficient and reduce their emissions.

Time and Statista used a transparent, multi-stage methodology to identify the world's most sustainable companies for 2024. The process began with a pool of over 5,000 of the world's largest and most influential companies. Following a rigorous four-stage assessment, the final ranking excluded unsustainable industries and considered factors like external sustainability ratings and commitments, corporate reporting practices, and environmental and social performance indicators. This comprehensive approach produced a ranking of 500 companies from over 30 countries.

Content: # Schneider Electric maintains spot atop Gartner's Top 25 supply chains

"The supply chain organizations in this year's Top 25 were notable for better-protecting growth rates in a challenging operating environment, while at the same time delivering more sustainable operations," said Simon Bailey, VP Analyst at Gartner. "The best supply chains now have ESG criteria firmly embedded in their operations, while delivering higher than average growth rates, better returns on physical assets (ROPA) and stronger margins."

Other companies that performed well in the rankings include Microsoft (4), Johnson & Johnson (5) and Diageo (6).

"Schneider Electric excelled across all components of our methodology, securing the highest number of Gartner expert votes," Bailey added. "The company benefits from a three-year transformation initiative that has enhanced customer and supplier relationships and improved operational resilience."

Title: Schneider Electric: 2025 TIME100 Most Influential Companies | TIME
URL: https://time.com/collections/time100-companies-2025/7296226/schneider-electric-2/
Content: For more than 20 years, Schneider Electric has been guided by an ambitious goal: to drive the global energy transition forward through electrification, digitalization and automation. Schneider’s products and services support everything from smart energy and building management to industrial automation and EV charging. The France-based multinational supports the sustainability practices of 40% of the Fortune 500. “We accompany customers from strategy to execution,” says Chief Sustainability Officer Esther Finidori.

One example of what that looks like: Schneider helps its customers buy renewable energy from suppliers, accounting for 60% of such purchasing in the U.S. market. “It’s complicated for corporations today to source renewable energy,” Finidori says. But with its global profile, Schneider says it has helped customers avoid 679 million metric tons of CO2 emissions since 2018—equivalent to taking over 130 million cars off the road for a year.

Supply Chain Digest

My question this time each year: What are the best supply chains in the world?

The reality is there is no way to determine that, absent an incredibly detailed study of leading icandidates that would even then lead to potentially dubious results and certainly be obsolete by the time the research was finished. Or, we could look at the Gartner top 25 supply chains list.

That famous ranking used to be released at a dinner the Gartner Supply Chain Executive Conference in May (now called the Supply Chain Symposium), but this year it was released in a webinar two weeks after the conference.

Let's take a look.

The former AMR Research brilliantly came up with the top 25 idea in 2004. Gartner then acquired AMR in 2010. Over the last few years, the concept has been extended, so that we now have a "Next 25," plus the top 25 healthcare, industrial, and consumer goods supply chains, etc.

At previous Gartner conferences, when asking around a bit, I found - not surprisingly - th...

Content: **Sydney Australia, 15 August, 2025 **– Schneider Electric, the leader in the digital transformation of energy management and automation, has placed first in the 2025 Gartner Top 25 Supply Chain for the third consecutive year.

The Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 ranking comprises two main components: business performance and community opinion. Business performance in the form of public financial and ESG (environmental, social, governance) data provides a view into how companies have performed in the past three years, while the community opinion component gives a peer and Gartner expert view to companies’ future potential and reflects leadership in the supply chain community. These two components are combined into a total composite score.

- Schneider Electric saw stronger-than-forecast revenue and adjusted earnings in 2024 as its customers’ data center investments — especially in North America — drove mid-double-digit growth in its energy management business, the company said Feb. 20.

- Year-over-year organic revenue growth accelerated 12% in the fourth quarter, supported by 25% growth in Schneider Electric’s North American energy management business. The company’s year-end 2024 sales backlog of 21.4 billion euros, or about $22.39 billion, was its highest ever, and the company plans to invest about 2 billion euros through 2027 to expand production capacity, it said.

Schneider Electric | 2024 Integrated Report
se.com
2024 marked the first year of Schneider Electric’s medium term 
goals set during the 2023 Capital Markets Day. How did the 
company’s performance align with these objectives?
In November 2023 we explained that five megatrends are driving  
a structural step-up in our markets with estimated potential 
addressable market growth of +6% to +7% CAGR (2023–2027)  
and we remain uniquely well positioned to capture this opportunity. 
Our ambitions for the Next Frontier for the company remain 
unchanged with organic revenue growth to be +7% to +10% CAGR 
(2023–2027) together with an organic expansion of adjusted EBITA 
margin of c.+50bps CAGR (2023–2027).
In 2024, we have had the support of all five megatrends with a 
particular acceleration tied to the advent of large-language models  
in AI supporting our Data Center business. The year highlighted the 
strength of our diversified yet focused business model: diversified 
geographically and focused from an end-mark...

Content: Schneider Electric, the leader in the digital transformation of energy management and automation, has placed first in the 2025 Gartner Top 25 Supply Chain for the third consecutive year.

The Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 ranking comprises two main components: business performance and community opinion. Business performance in the form of public financial and ESG (environmental, social, governance) data provides a view into how companies have performed in the past three years, while the community opinion component gives a peer and Gartner expert view to companies’ future potential and reflects leadership in the supply chain community. These two components are combined into a total composite score.

“We are humbled to be recognized by Gartner and our industry peers,” said Mourad Tamoud, Schneider Electric’s Chief Supply Chain Officer. “We remain focused on delivering value to our customers and raising the bar on sustainability. By continuously investing in our people and in advanced technologies of the Fourth In...

**Microsoft**, **Apple**, **Nvidia**, **Amazon**, **Alphabet**, **Meta Platforms**, and **Tesla**, the "Magnificent Seven" may be the most important stocks of this generation. After collectively rising 107% in 2023 -- and another 14% so far in 2024 -- each of these businesses now hold market capitalizations between $600 billion and $3.1 trillion.

To put this size in context, these stocks now account for roughly 30% of the

**S&P 500** index's total market cap of $44.5 trillion. Home to many bleeding-edge technologies in today's world, it is tough to argue that the Magnificent Seven doesn't deserve this massive allocation of funds.

However, one company works behind the scenes to keep these juggernauts' operations humming: Netherlands-based

Title: Investment Insights: ASML - Middleton Enterprises
URL: https://middletonenterprises.com/investment-insights-asml-2/
Content: We recently revisited our review of ASML. In the below note, we’ll discuss the reasons why we view ASML as an exceptional business.

ASML designs, assembles and sells machines used in the semiconductor (chip) manufacturing process.

The core part of ASML’s business is selling lithography machines & other systems equipment. The remaining services part, c.20% of sales, relates to maintenance, customer support & upgrades.

The service’s business is subscription-like and given that 95% of lithography machines are still in service, maintenance & repair represents a 20+ year annuity.

Content: ## Arm Holdings plc American Depositary Shares - Porter's Five Forces: Bargaining power of suppliers

The bargaining power of suppliers for Arm Holdings plc is influenced by several factors that shape the dynamics of its supply chain. Analyzing these elements reveals critical insights into how suppliers can impact the company's operations and costs.

### Limited number of specialized suppliers

Arm Holdings relies on a limited number of specialized suppliers for essential components such as semiconductor chips and design tools. For instance, the global semiconductor industry is highly concentrated, with the top three firms—TSMC, Samsung, and Intel—accounting for around

**60%** of the market share. This concentration limits Arm's options and gives existing suppliers substantial power over pricing.

### High switching costs for suppliers

Switching costs are substantial in the semiconductor industry due to the need for specific expertise and technology compatibility. The investment required in retooling produc...

Content: Here is the revenue trend for Arm between Q1 of its fiscal 2017 through Q4 of fiscal 2024 based on the mid-point of the guidance that the top brass at the company gave to Wall Street yesterday after the market close:

Arm will shortly break through a $4 billion annualized run rate, if current trends persist, and it may have a rosy outlook because the Armv9 architecture that debuted a few years back and that is now appearing in clients and servers has approximately twice the royalty price of the Armv8 architecture that preceded it. Speaking with

*This article was originally published on Forbes on Aug 15, 2024, 05:09pm EDT*

Arm Holdings is the third-best performer of 2024 in AI-related semiconductor stocks with a 56% YTD return, behind only Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. The stock is a market favorite as Arm’s heterogenous compute design has created a monopoly in mobile, primarily, yet Arm’s RISC architecture is also found in PCs, powers sensors and supercomputers. In total, over 280 billion Arm-based chips have been shipped dating back to the 1980s.

The latest Arm v9 architecture offers significant improvements in performance and efficiency, particularly for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. This has led to increased adoption by premium smartphone partners, and also with hyperscalers that are developing their own custom silicon for data center use.

The market is excited about Arm’s v9 architecture because it commands double the royal...

Content: Softbank has taken Arm Holdings public (Nasdaq: ARM). That means we are finally seeing their numbers again. And we’re getting a good window into how management describes its business model and strategic priorities right now.

In this first article, I’m going to detail how I think about Arm Holdings strategy, which has been enormously successful.

- In Part 2, I’m going to lay out the 5 big digital concepts powering their business model.

- And in Part 3, I’ll talk about the external factors that are changing their trajectory (mostly AI and China).... ## How I Think About Arm Holdings

I break ARM into four questions:

**Are they benefiting from a secular trend?**

- I like companies that have a tailwind and can naturally grow.

- ARM has been riding a global secular trend (i.e., smartphone adoption) for decades. How this will change going forward is a big question.

**What is the state of the core growth engine?**

- I really like when there is great product-market-fit (PMF) on a long-term secular growth tren...

"Based on our current backlog and demand visibility, we expect sales to decline between the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 well above normal seasonality," STMicroelectronics said in a statement.
Semiconductor companies such as STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments and Melexis are facing weak industrial markets, as customers scale back orders with falling demand for cars.
Analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting full-year sales of $13.26 billion.

Dear Aldo Kamper, what was decisive for ams OSRAM looking back on the 2024 
­business year?
Aldo Kamper: 2024 was both a difficult and a successful year. We made key ad­vances 
wherever things were in our own hands, and that was despite the weak economic 
trends. We’re proud of that. We consistently pressed ahead with our strategic ‘Re-es-
tablish the Base’ efficiency program, and in part lowered run-rate costs faster than 
initially planned. That impacted very beneficially on profitability and the free cash flow. 
We had to take tough decisions, and, as promised, we shed our less profitable units 
along with those that are no longer part of our core semiconductor business. We suc-
cessfully spun off our passive optical components operations and restructured other

­refocusing is starting  
to bear fruit”
Dear Aldo Kamper, what was decisive for ams OSRAM looking back on the 2024 
­business year?
Aldo Kamper: 2024 was both a difficult and a successful year. We made key ad­vances 
wherever things were in our own hands, and that was despite the weak economic 
trends. We’re proud of that. We consistently pressed ahead with our strategic ‘Re-es-
tablish the Base’ efficiency program, and in part lowered run-rate costs faster than 
initially planned. That impacted very beneficially on profitability and the free cash flow. 
We had to take tough decisions, and, as promised, we shed our less profitable units 
along with those that are no longer part of our core semiconductor business. We suc-
cessfully spun off our passive optical components operations and restructured other 
units. Furthermore, we simply let the remaining legacy business phase out more or less

## Project focus

For 90 percent of OSRAM products, the ams OSRAM site in Schwabmünchen supplies pre-manufactured components. These include tungsten wires for vehicle headlamp lighting and chemical raw materials for LED products. The plant, which has been in operation since 1961, has been intensively using IoT and digitalization technologies for about 20 years.

The impetus for the project, which was awarded the INDUSTRIE 4.0 AWARD, came from a “Zero-Incident” requirement set by a customer in 2018 for the approximately 260 million lamps delivered annually. Traditional methods such as Six Sigma were not sufficient to manage the extraordinarily high complexity of the production process: 60 process steps are carried out at the plant, followed by another 60 at two other company locations. Unlike the classic “Single Product” approach, a single error in this process cannot simply be eliminated.

Content: Austria-based ams OSRAM is a multinational photonics application developer, focusing on sensors, LEDs and light-based treatment solutions.

ams OSRAM is at the forefront of microLED epiwafer production. In 2021, the company announced that it will expand its LED production plant in Kulim, Malaysia, with an investment of around $850 million, with plans to produce mini-LED and micro-LED chips on 8-inch wafers. ams OSRAM hoped to enter microLED mass production in 2024, mainly to supply microLEDs to Apple.

In February 2024, ams-Osram announced that it's cornerstone customer (Apple) cancelled its microLED project, which will have dire implications for Osram's own $850 million 8-inch microLED epiwafer factory in Malaysia - ams-Osram estimated that it will have impairment charges of $650 to $900 million and it will also likely to cancel or delay some of its investments in Malaysia.

shareholders
Dear Melexis shareholder,
2024 has been an unusual year for Melexis. I commend the many 
achievements our team has made, but I want to start by 
commenting on our primary end market, the automotive industry. 
Although automotive production and sales remain broadly stable, 
this industry is undergoing profound changes: new legislation, 
technology and consumer preferences continue to result in an 
increasing number of electrified vehicles, with fully electric or 
hybrid powertrains, and electronic content growth making cars 
greener, safer and more comfortable. Melexis' global presence and 
diversified customer base is a real strength in the context of major 
shifts in automotive manufacturing and supply chain management. 
Next to the dynamics in the automotive sector, demand for 
semiconductors started to exceed supply in 2020, leading to an 
extended period of chip shortages and triggering investment in 
additional capacity. We finally exited this period of constrained 
supply dur...

Content: While European carmakers are adapting to the electrification trend, Asia is emerging as a dominant force, with high production and sales volumes, fueled by a growing middle class. Adapting to the expectations of Asian customers, who prioritize speed, cost efficient solutions and specific product requirements, is crucial. In order to do this, we are already actively building strong connections in Asia. The inauguration of our new facility in Malaysia in the summer of 2024 will give us extra impact in the entire region. I would like to commend our colleagues in Kyiv for their outstanding work in very difficult conditions. They delivered a major project for a key customer with excellence. In 2024, they are working on another very important project for another key customer with impressive commitment. We are immensely proud of our people in Ukraine for their resilience and motivation.

Content: ## Customer Concentration

Let’s talk about one of the bigger risks Melexis faces—

**customer concentration**. After half of 2024, their **10 largest customers accounted for 43% of total revenues**, with the **biggest one alone contributing 13%**. That’s a lot of eggs in just a few baskets.

Why does this matter? For starters, it gives those key customers significant

**negotiating power**, potentially limiting Melexis’ ability to raise prices. Even more concerning, if one of these major clients were to hit financial trouble—or worse, go bankrupt—the ripple effect on Melexis could be substantial.

Looking at the bigger picture, the story stays pretty focused: a staggering 90% of Melexis' revenue comes from the automotive world—a famously cyclical industry. When the going is good, automakers pour money into big contracts and ramp up production. But when the economy stumbles, they slam the brakes, cutting back on spending and scaling down operations. We’ve seen this firsthand with Melexis’ 2024 revenue outlook...

After half of 2024, their **10 largest customers accounted for 43% of total revenues**, with the **biggest one alone contributing 13%**. That’s a lot of eggs in just a few baskets.\n\nWhy does this matter? For starters, it gives those key customers significant\n\n**negotiating power**, potentially limiting Melexis’ ability to raise prices. Even more concerning, if one of these major clients were to hit financial trouble—or worse, go bankrupt—the ripple effect on Melexis could be substantial.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture, the story stays pretty focused: a staggering 90% of Melexis' revenue comes from the automotive world—a famously cyclical industry. When the going is good, automakers pour money into big contracts and ramp up production. But when the economy stumbles, they slam the brakes, cutting back on spending and scaling down operations.

Three main raw materials fall under the Base Metals category, namely aluminum, copper and 
lead, with copper and aluminum representing the majority of the Group’s raw material 
purchases.  
Prysmian’s production process starts from aluminum and copper wire rod for the 
manufacturing of cable conductors. These metals are purchased from the world’s leading 
mining and smelting companies. The Group only self-produces minor quantities of wire rod 
(less than 10% of copper and 25% of aluminum total consumption).
