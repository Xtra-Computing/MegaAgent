- Asia is home to key manufacturers crucial to the global AI supply chain.

- Nvidia pays ~US$10 billion for TSMC to manufacture their AI accelerator chips.

- Chinese consumer technology companies are integrating their own AI models within core business segments.

Many investors would be familiar with the Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks given they have collectively been the largest driver of US equity returns in recent years, for good reason.

These companies are pioneering the AI race with billions of dollars being spent on data centres to provide the infrastructure required to train the latest foundational LLMs (large-language models) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.

But the AI ecosystem is much broader than just these seven companies.

## At a glance

- Asia is home to key manufacturers crucial to the global AI supply chain.

- Nvidia pays ~US$10 billion for TSMC to manufacture their AI accelerator chips.

- Chinese consumer technology companies are integrating their own AI models within core business segments.

Many investors would be familiar with the Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks given they have collectively been the largest driver of US equity returns in recent years, for good reason.

These companies are pioneering the AI race with billions of dollars being spent on data centres to provide the infrastructure required to train the latest foundational LLMs (large-language models) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini.

But the AI ecosystem is much broader than just these seven companies.

NVIDIA is an AI-chip powerhouse, but long-time chip maker AMD is throwing some serious compute power into the game. It announced the Ryzen AI Pro 300 series chips late last year.

These are the company’s third generation commercial AI mobile processors, and they offer three times the performance of the previous generation of chips. Designed for AI-powered laptops — operating at the cutting edge of workplace demand — they can handle trillions of operations per second and exceed Microsoft’s AI power requirements. A partnership between AMD and Microsoft means these are the chips that power the AI built into Microsoft’s Copilot PCs.

## DRAM market fluctuations

Overall DRAM revenues amounted to 26.02 billion U.S. dollars for the third quarter of 2024, up from the 22.9 billion U.S. dollars observed in the second quarter of 2024. Samsung is the largest manufacturer of DRAM in terms of revenues.

## DRAM vs SRAM

The primary memory of a computer is called RAM, with the two most used forms of modern RAM being static RAM (SRAM) and dynamic RAM (DRAM). DRAM is a type of volatile memory which, unlike non-volatile flash memory, loses data quickly when cut off from a power supply. Compared to other varieties of volatile memory, DRAM is relatively structurally simple. Whereas SRAM requires four to six transistors per bit, DRAM requires only one transistor and capacitor per bit.

Content: Greeting 
 
Thanks to the support of our shareholders and other stakeholders, the Company was newly 
listed on the Prime Market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange on December 18, 2024. 
The Kioxia Group is a leading company in flash memory and SSDs that delivers various 
forms of value to people around the world under the mission of “Uplifting the World with 
‘Memory.’” The name “Kioxia” is derived from the Japanese word “kioku” (memory) and the 
Greek word “axia” (value). Since inventing NAND flash memory in 1987, we have supported 
the development of a digital society with memory technology as our core. 
In FY2024, we achieved record-high performance in revenue, operating profit, and profit 
attributable to owners of parent since becoming independent from the Toshiba Group in 
FY2018, primarily due to rising average selling prices (ASPs), increased bit shipments, and 
the positive effect of exchange rates. 
Going forward, as generative AI becomes more widespread, data utilization needs will 
become more diverse, a...

Content: # Rapidus US chief says AI chip crunch, supply chain paranoia make for an ideal growth climate... ## Japanese foundry upstart aims to bolster domestic production while catering to growing demand for custom accelerators

Interview The foundry space is arguably the most complex and competitive it has been in decades as foundry upstarts in the US and Japan look to challenge heavyweights Samsung and TSMC for a piece of the action.

But while Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger aims to leapfrog Samsung as the number two foundry operator, Henri Richard, the newly appointed president and general manager of Japan's Rapidus Design Solutions, doesn't believe it's necessary to challenge TSMC directly to be successful given the current climate.

"I personally believe that the demand is understated," Richard tells

*The Register*.

The sentiment echoes that of others in the industry, including TSMC, Intel, and OpenAI's Sam Altman. The latter has reportedly been raising billions to support a network of fabs, datacenters, and power pla...

Page 6 is breakdown by segment. I will go through each segment later on, but for both IT Services and Social Infrastructure, we achieved both revenue and profit growth versus last year.

For others, although we sold JAE shares, we acknowledged structural reform expenses and thus a minus JPY 5.4 billion.

Unknown Executive

For adjustments, there was reversal impact because we enjoyed gains from asset streamlining and IP last year. We also increased internal DX investments and overall saw an expense increase of JPY 18.2 billion.

Page 7. I will now go through each of our segments, starting with IT Services.

Revenue grew, driven by domestic IT. Due to strong demand from Enterprise and government sectors, domestic IT saw revenue increase of more than 10%.

For adjusted operating profit, on top of profit increase due to revenue increase, domestic SI profitability improvements also contributed to the growth.

Business Strategies (Business Portfolio)
We have redefined our business portfolio into five categories. At the forefront are our high-growth businesses, which hold leadership 
positions in expanding markets. We will concentrate our resources in these areas to unlock their full potential and accelerate growth.
Revenue growth businesses operate in mature markets, but they have strong positions with a stable revenue base. Here we aim to achieve 
an ROS of 10% or more through appropriate management of fixed costs and capital investment.
We will improve on low profitability in transformation businesses and project loss prevention businesses by identifying factors behind 
profit declines and taking improvement measures, with the aim of securing an ROS of 5% or more.

Content: ・Both net sales and income decreased in the component sales 
business due to the impact of inventory adjustment taking 
place on a full-scale since 3Q, in addition to disappearance of 
spot demand that had contributed to earnings until the 
previous fiscal year, given easing of supply shortages of 
semiconductors and electronic components, and diminution of 
transactions with a certain major client of Excel.
・Kaga FEI’s SoC (System on a Chip) products continued to enjoy 
robust sales.
・In the EMS business, net sales and income declined due partly 
to the impact of inventory adjustments at key customers in 
applications related to medical, industrial and air-conditioning 
equipment, despite sales growth in the automotive sector 
resulting from improved supply and demand balance of 
semiconductors and electronic components.

Amid Gartner's forecast for a significant increase in global semiconductor sales in 2024 and 2025, driven by demand for AI chips, memory prices, and consumer devices like PCs and smartphones, Singapore's tech stocks have garnered widespread attention.

Technology Stocks Make Big Moves in Global Markets

Over the past decade, tech stocks have taken off, growing their share in global indexes from 10% to a whopping 25%. In the US, the biggest tech players show a median price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40x, which is double the tech sector's average of 20x. That's a lot higher than in consumer sectors, where the top companies have a P/E of 20x compared to 14x for the rest.

In Singapore, companies like $Venture (V03.SG)$ , $Frencken (E28.SG)$, and $UMS (558.SG)$ have seen mixed results. Venture's returns dipped by 10.6%, while Frencken enjoyed a 7.5% increase, and UMS Integration topped them with a 17.4% rise, all measured annuall...

In a surprising revelation, documents submitted by Nvidia to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 21, 2023, unveiled that Singapore accounted for around 15% of Nvidia’s revenue in the third quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, translating to about USD 2.7 billion. This positions Singapore as the fourth largest market for Nvidia globally, trailing behind the US and China (including Taiwan and Hong Kong).

Notably, this marks the first time that Nvidia has explicitly disclosed Singapore as a separate consumer market in its financial reports. Previously, revenue data for the US, mainland China, and Taiwan were the main highlights, with these three markets typically representing 70–85% of the market share, while others, including Singapore, were grouped under “Others.”

Content: This article first appeared in Capital, The Edge Malaysia Weekly on September 23, 2024 - September 29, 2024

THE technology sector has gone on a wild swing in 2024, erasing almost all of its gains so far this year. At its height in mid-July, the Bursa Malaysia Technology Index was trading at 55 times price-earnings ratio, easing to 37 times PER at present, which is within its historical average of 38 times over the last five-year period.

Many established local semiconductor companies have seen declines in their share price year to date (YTD), some of them between 10% and 40%.

The question is why investors are shying away from technology stocks, especially semiconductor players, when late last year, global technology stocks benefited from investor interest, driven by the surge in artificial intelligence (AI) led by chip giants such as Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc....

Content: The limited capacity in the data center sector is likely to push the local data center industry toward higher-value AI use cases.

Kiran Karunakaran, partner at Bain & Company, expects the city-state to take the lead in the region to convert existing data center capacity to AI-enabled facilities.

He estimates that firms operating large-scale cloud platforms, such as Google and Amazon, account for 70% of data center usage in the country. These companies will likely leverage their presence in Singapore for AI workloads while shifting more traditional workloads to Malaysia and Indonesia.

“Many of the data centers in Singapore have already started thinking about AI workloads, says Karunakaran. He adds that in terms of readiness, they are “already ahead” when it comes to availability of graphics processing units – semiconductor chips used to train and run AI models – as well as conversion of existing Tier 4 data centers to AI-enabled ones.

This positions Singapore as the fourth largest market for Nvidia globally, trailing behind the US and China (including Taiwan and Hong Kong).\n\nNotably, this marks the first time that Nvidia has explicitly disclosed Singapore as a separate consumer market in its financial reports. Previously, revenue data for the US, mainland China, and Taiwan were the main highlights, with these three markets typically representing 70–85% of the market share, while others, including Singapore, were grouped under “Others.”\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s recent tour of four Asian countries, including Singapore, ...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 9:\nTitle: Potential upside in local tech stocks despite short-term challenges\nURL: https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/727763\nContent: This article first appeared in Capital, The Edge Malaysia Weekly on September 23, 2024 - September 29, 2024\n\nTHE technology sector has gone on a wild swing in 2024, erasing almost all of its gains so far this year.

In March, I visited Taiwan to attend the Bank of America Securities Asia Technology Conference. The conference—my first post-COVID research trip to Taiwan—offered access to a wide range of local technology companies and industry experts. I came away with valuable insights into Taiwan’s evolving position in the global tech landscape, particularly amid the booming demand for generative AI ignited by ChatGPT’s late 2022 launch.

The Taiwan market’s outperformance vs. EM during 2023 and 2024 would not have been possible without its cluster of AI-related companies. If Nvidia, the AI GPU chip designer, is the center of the GenAI technology kingdom, Taiwanese technology companies make up much of the realm surrounding and supporting it.
