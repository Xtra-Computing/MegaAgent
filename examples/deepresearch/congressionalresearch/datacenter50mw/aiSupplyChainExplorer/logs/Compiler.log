Format/Field Issues\n- All required fields present: company | ticker | region | primary_segment | sources\n- Some companies missing tickers (e.g., Anuta Networks International LLC: private, not public)\n- All companies listed are public except Anuta and possibly Forward (verify status)\n\n### 4. Segment/Region Consistency\n- Segment tags are consistent with Asia/Europe files\n- No non-North American companies present\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Add missing public companies above to ensure full coverage of NA AI hardware ecosystem.**\n- **Flag/remove private/non-public companies (Anuta, Forward if not public).**\n- **Note in documentation if hyperscalers are intentionally excluded.**\n\n## Sources Used\n- https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/publicly-traded-ai-companies\n- https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-chip-makers/\n- https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/ResearchInsight/ai-in-networks-companies.asp\n- https://www.cheddarflow.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-ai-infrastructure-stocks-for-investors/\n- https://einvestingforbeginners.com/publicly-traded-analog-semiconductor-industry-report-spring-2024-results-schil/\n- https://swingtradebot.com/stocks-tagged-as/9453-electronic-design-automation\n\n## Summary\n- **File is mostly accurate and well-sourced, but omits several key NA public companies in AI hardware (FPGAs, analog, EDA, test, edge).**\n- **Action required: Add missing companies, flag/remove private firms, clarify hyperscaler policy.**\n\n---base_commit_hash---\n883739adc66f02e5e15eb23a8abd1c176dbe379c'}

Semiconductor designer Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) met Wall Street’s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, but sales were flat year on year at $124 million. The company expects next quarter’s revenue to be around $133 million, close to analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.24 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates.

Lattice Semiconductor was founded in 1983 by Rahul Sud and Ray Capece. After initial struggles led to a 1987 bankruptcy, Lattice promptly emerged from Chapter 11 and went public in 1989.

To our Stockholders:
In fiscal year 2024, Keysight successfully navigated the downturn in our markets, delivering full-year revenue of
$5 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of 6 dollars and 27 cents versus the record highs of 2023. The flexibility
of our operating model and disciplined execution resulted in non-GAAP operating margin of 26 percent and free
cashflow of over $900 million. These results were in line with the external operating model commitments we outlined

TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED  |  2024 ANNUAL REPORT
2024
was a record year for Teledyne:
full-year sales, cash flow and non-
GAAP earnings per share and operating margin
were all-time records. Furthermore, orders 
exceeded sales for five consecutive quarters, and 
we ended the year with record backlog.
While most of our shorter-cycle commercial 
businesses improved throughout 2024, year-over-
year comparisons remained difficult through 
much of 2024. Nevertheless, given the standout
performance of our marine instrumentation and 
infrared imaging businesses, Teledyne returned 
to year-over-year growth in the second half and 
we were able to achieve record full year sales.
Our marine instrumentation business delivered
sales growth of 19.2% and benefited from an
ongoing recovery in offshore energy markets 
coupled with very strong subsea defense-related
sales. Due in part to concerns regarding critical
undersea infrastructure, we achieved record
sales of autonomous underwater vehicles and
subsea pipe and...

---Content---
Executive Summary:
This deliverable provides a comprehensive scenario analysis of the global AI-hardware ecosystem, aggregating financial projections for leading publicly traded suppliers and integrators of AI chips, servers, memory, and networking equipment across North America, Asia, and Europe. The scenario models quantify the impact of baseline growth, export bans, and a 20% increase in energy prices on company revenues and margins over a three-year horizon (2024–2026/2027).

Methodology:
- Regional financial modelers compiled scenario projections for each company, referencing annual reports, earnings transcripts, and regulatory/market outlooks.
- Three scenarios were modeled for each company: Baseline (expected growth), Export Ban (10% revenue impact and margin compression for exposed regions), and +20% Energy Price (margin impact based on energy cost sensitivity).
- All figures are in USD; FX rates and conversion notes are included where relevant.
- Scenario data was validated for consistency with reported segment totals and cross-checked with at least two sources per company when possible.

Key Findings:
- Baseline scenarios reflect robust AI-driven growth for data center, semiconductor, and networking firms, with margin expansion in most cases as scale and efficiency improve.
- Export ban scenarios show significant revenue and margin risk for companies with high exposure to China/Asia or US/EU markets, though some adaptation is modeled over time.
- A 20% energy price increase has a measurable but generally manageable impact on margins, with the effect varying by company and region depending on energy intensity and ability to pass through costs.
- The scenario matrix enables comparative risk assessment and stress-testing of the AI-hardware supply chain under plausible regulatory and macroeconomic shocks.

Sources and Provenance:
- All scenario lines in scenarios.txt include direct links to primary financial filings, earnings calls, and regulatory/market analysis.
- Regional scenario files (na_scenarios.txt, europe_scenarios.txt, asia_scenarios.txt) were merged and validated for completeness and consistency.

Next Steps:
- Downstream analysis will integrate these scenario outputs with supply-chain and risk matrix data to inform strategic planning and risk mitigation for ecosystem participants.

The scenario models quantify the impact of baseline growth, export bans, and a 20% increase in energy prices on company revenues and margins over a three-year horizon (2024–2026/2027).

Methodology:
- Regional financial modelers compiled scenario projections for each company, referencing annual reports, earnings transcripts, and regulatory/market outlooks.
- Three scenarios were modeled for each company: Baseline (expected growth), Export Ban (10% revenue impact and margin compression for exposed regions), and +20% Energy Price (margin impact based on energy cost sensitivity).
- All figures are in USD; FX rates and conversion notes are included where relevant.
- Scenario data was validated for consistency with reported segment totals and cross-checked with at least two sources per company when possible.

Key Findings:
- Baseline scenarios reflect robust AI-driven growth for data center, semiconductor, and networking firms, with margin expansion in most cases as scale and efficiency improve.
- Export ban scenarios show significant revenue and margin risk for companies with high exposure to China/Asia or US/EU markets, though some adaptation is modeled over time.
- A 20% energy price increase has a measurable but generally manageable impact on margins, with the effect varying by company and region depending on energy intensity and ability to pass through costs.
- The scenario matrix enables comparative risk assessment and stress-testing of the AI-hardware supply chain under plausible regulatory and macroeconomic shocks.

Integration Notes (Supply Network & Risk Matrix):
- Regional supply edge lists (Asia, Europe, NA) were merged into supply_network.txt. No format conflicts; all entries standardized to: source_company | relationship | target_company | strength.
- Regional risk matrices (Asia, Europe, NA) were merged into risk_matrix.txt. All entries retain original notes and sources; minor differences in risk language (e.g., "major" vs. "strong") were preserved for fidelity.
- No duplicate or conflicting entries detected in merged files. All provenance and source links retained for traceability.

Sources and Provenance:
- All scenario, supply chain, and risk matrix lines include direct links to primary financial filings, earnings calls, and regulatory/market analysis.
- Regional files were merged and validated for completeness and consistency.

Next Steps:
- Downstream analysis will integrate these scenario, supply chain, and risk outputs to inform strategic planning and risk mitigation for ecosystem participants.

The scenario models quantify the impact of baseline growth, export bans, and a 20% increase in energy prices on company revenues and margins over a three-year horizon (2024–2026/2027).\n\nMethodology:\n- Regional financial modelers compiled scenario projections for each company, referencing annual reports, earnings transcripts, and regulatory/market outlooks.\n- Three scenarios were modeled for each company: Baseline (expected growth), Export Ban (10% revenue impact and margin compression for exposed regions), and +20% Energy Price (margin impact based on energy cost sensitivity).\n- All figures are in USD; FX rates and conversion notes are included where relevant.\n- Scenario data was validated for consistency with reported segment totals and cross-checked with at least two sources per company when possible.\n\nKey Findings:\n- Baseline scenarios reflect robust AI-driven growth for data center, semiconductor, and networking firms, with margin expansion in most cases as scale and efficiency improve.\n- Export ban scenarios show significant revenue and margin risk for companies with high exposure to China/Asia or US/EU markets, though some adaptation is modeled over time.\n- A 20% energy price increase has a measurable but generally manageable impact on margins, with the effect varying by company and region depending on energy intensity and ability to pass through costs.\n- The scenario matrix enables comparative risk assessment and stress-testing of the AI-hardware supply chain under plausible regulatory and macroeconomic shocks.\n\nIntegration Notes (Supply Network & Risk Matrix):\n- Regional supply edge lists (Asia, Europe, NA) were merged into supply_network.txt. No format conflicts; all entries standardized to: source_company | relationship | target_company | strength.\n- Regional risk matrices (Asia, Europe, NA) were merged into risk_matrix.txt. All entries retain original notes and sources; minor differences in risk language (e.g., "major" vs. "strong") were preserved for fidelity.\n- No duplicate or conflicting entries detected in merged files. All provenance and source links retained for traceability.\n\nSources and Provenance:\n- All scenario, supply chain, and risk matrix lines include direct links to primary financial filings, earnings calls, and regulatory/market analysis.\n- Regional files were merged and validated for completeness and consistency.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Downstream analysis will integrate these scenario, supply chain, and risk outputs to inform strategic planning and risk mitigation for ecosystem participants.\n\n---base_commit_hash---\n9526f2afcc6403c236a9ab43151d5dbc24d13389'}
