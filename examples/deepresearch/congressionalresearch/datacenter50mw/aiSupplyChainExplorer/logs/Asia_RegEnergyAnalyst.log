Title: Understanding the Biden Administration's Updated Export Controls
URL: https://www.csis.org/analysis/understanding-biden-administrations-updated-export-controls
Content: ### Available Downloads

On December 2, 2024, the Biden administration published two new (with more evidently still to come) updates to the China AI and semiconductor export controls that it released in October 2022. As with the first Trump administration—which made major changes to semiconductor export control policy during its final months in office—these late-term Biden export controls are a bombshell. At a high level, the new controls take eight major actions:

- Expanding country-wide chip-level export controls to restrict High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM), a type of memory that is critical for AI applications;

- Updating the list of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) that is restricted on a country-wide basis to include additional equipment for producing HBM, DRAM, and advanced packaging;

- Updating the list of SME that is restricted on an end-use and end-user basis to include additional chokepoint technologies;

Content: ## Executive Summary

Since October 2022, the United States has devoted significant resources to restricting China’s access to artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced semiconductor technologies. In the final months of the Biden administration, the Department of Commerce issued four additional far-reaching export control updates. On December 2, 2024, it released two rules that added 140 companies to the Entity List, expanded the scope of the Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR), and restricted new technology areas such as high-bandwidth memory, among other measures. In the second week of January 2025, the Department of Commerce issued the AI Diffusion Framework and the Foundry Due Diligence Rule, further shaping the spread of AI and semiconductor technologies throughout the world. Export controls remain front and center for the second Trump administration, which directed an effort to “identify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls—especially those that enable the transfer of strategic goods, soft...

Content: # U.S. Semiconductor Export Controls and Their Implications to Korea

6 Pages Posted: 20 Mar 2024

Date Written: December 15, 2023... ### Abstract

In October 2022, the United States implemented its most stringent semiconductor export control measures to date, and in October 2023, these measures were further expanded. These controls primarily target two facets of the Chinese semiconductor industry: chip manufacturing and the use of AI chips in data centers.

Regarding chip manufacturing, the U.S. seeks to limit China's ability to manufacture chips by controlling the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME). After the export control, there was a severe decline in SME imports in regions dominated by Chinese firms (Beijing, Shanghai, Anhui, and Hubei) and multinational corporations (Shaanxi, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and Fujian). Korea, which produces SMEs that complement U.S. SMEs, experienced a notable decline in SME exports to China across all regions.... In the area of AI chips, the BIS has brought AI ...

**The United States Leading Global Controls on AI Chip Exports **

Since the rise of global artificial intelligence (AI) competitions, an increasing number of countries have imposed export control measures and trade restrictions on the transshipment of semiconductors, which reflects their growing concerns over national and allied security. The evolving global semiconductor supply chain has become a focal point of geopolitical tensions, as governments aim to secure their technological competitiveness and protect critical infrastructure. These measures and restrictions on semiconductors are deeply intertwined with AI development, as advanced chips are the backbone of AI systems. Countries im...

Content: |Briefings ## South Korea secures US AI tech access amid tightened export controls worldwide Access to cutting-edge AI chips boosts South Korea’s tech edge but raises challenges in China trade relations South Korea announced that the country is exempt from the Biden administration’s newly updated export controls on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips and AI models. The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) unveiled these measures on Tuesday, tightening restrictions on AI exports to safeguard national security. South Korea joins 17 other countries in retaining unrestricted access to U.S.-origin AI technologies, while export licenses remain required for shipments to countries such as China and Russia. The ROK trade ministry emphasized that the exemption ensures no disruption to South Korea’s imports of advanced U.S. AI technologies.

Content: ## Executive Summary

Since October 2022, the United States has devoted significant resources to restricting China’s access to artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced semiconductor technologies. In the final months of the Biden administration, the Department of Commerce issued four additional far-reaching export control updates. On December 2, 2024, it released two rules that added 140 companies to the Entity List, expanded the scope of the Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR), and restricted new technology areas such as high-bandwidth memory, among other measures. In the second week of January 2025, the Department of Commerce issued the AI Diffusion Framework and the Foundry Due Diligence Rule, further shaping the spread of AI and semiconductor technologies throughout the world. Export controls remain front and center for the second Trump administration, which directed an effort to “identify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls—especially those that enable the transfer of strategic goods, soft...

Title: The Limits of Chip Export Controls in Meeting the China ...
URL: https://www.csis.org/analysis/limits-chip-export-controls-meeting-china-challenge
Content: The U.S. government and those of its allies have imposed and progressively tightened controls on the export of semiconductor technology, devices, and tools to China in an effort to maintain U.S. leadership in this critical sector. China has responded with an all-out effort to stimulate domestic chip innovation capabilities and eliminate dependency on foreign sources. The outcome of the chip innovation race will determine which country leads in the development and application of AI, with major strategic and economic security implications.

Preventing China from acquiring the most advanced chip technology makes sense from a national security perspective, but export restrictions alone cannot substitute for comprehensive industrial and research policy measures necessary to ensure U.S. leadership in semiconductor design, production, and infrastructure. Moreover, the imposition of export controls has resulted in China doubling down on its existing deeply subsidized development efforts that could well produce breakt...

Content: # Overly Stringent Export Controls Chip Away at American AI Leadership

The Biden administration’s export control policy for AI chips has largely been a failure since day one. Yet, year after year, it has doubled down, attempting to plug various loopholes. The policy has now expanded to an almost comical extent—but the consequences are no joke. While the U.S. government is right to prevent U.S. companies from selling advanced AI technology to the Chinese military, cutting U.S. companies off from the entire Chinese market is a cure worse than the disease. It will ultimately harm both U.S. national security and economic interests.

The Biden administration issued its first AI chip export controls in October 2022, restricting the export of AI chips to China, as well as the technology to manufacture those chips. Since then, it has expanded those restrictions to cover additional countries, less-advanced chips, and related hardware components (e.g., high-bandwidth memory).

URL: https://ai-frontiers.org/articles/us-chip-export-controls-china-ai
Content: For over half a decade, the United States has imposed significant semiconductor export controls on China, aiming to slow China’s chip industry and to retain US leadership in the computing capabilities that undergird AI advances. Have these controls achieved their goals? Have the assumptions driving them been confirmed or undermined by the rapid evolution of the chip industry and AI capabilities?

**Three factors for assessing chip export controls. **We can now draw preliminary conclusions by assessing three factors: China’s domestic chipmaking capability, the sophistication of its AI models, and its market share in providing AI infrastructure.

Initial evidence shows that controls have succeeded in several important ways, though not all. Restrictions on chipmaking tool sales have significantly slowed the growth of China’s chipmaking capability. However, restrictions on the export of AI chips to China, while creating challenges, have not prevented Chinese labs from producing highly competitive models (though t...

Content: Tightened controls on exports of advanced technologies with US-origin components or technologies will affect key semiconductor-related manufacturing sectors. Southeast Asia can respond with short, medium, and long-run strategies.

Trump 2.0 has inherited recently strengthened export controls that block access to US chips and technologies from its adversaries. The third package of export controls, issued by the Biden Administration on 3 December 2024, carry provisions on extraterritorial Foreign-Direct Product Rule (FDPR). This means that goods under the US government’s Commerce Control List produced outside the US but with US-origin components or technologies may be subjected to export controls.

The third package of export controls will affect semiconductor-manufacturing equipment (machines used to manufacture semiconductors) produced in Malaysia and Singapore. Currently, Singapore is a major exporter of semiconductor-manufacturing equipment to China. In 2023, Singapore exported US$6.4 billion of such equipm...

Content: ### Global licence requirement for AI chips

Under the Framework Rule, certain AI chips are now subject to a global licence requirement. This means a licence is required for

**any export, re-export or in-country transfer of AI chips to any country**, subject to certain licence exceptions.

This represents a marked expansion of controls of these AI chips. They were previously only restricted, primarily, for exports to China and certain other embargoed jurisdictions.

Specifically, the AI chips covered are ECCNs 3A090.a, 4A090.a and related .z items, such as Nvidia's A100, A800 and H100 chips.

### Global licence requirement for model weights

For the first time, certain AI model weights require licences for

**export, re-export or in-country transfer (even within the US)**, unless the model weights are publicly available.

Specifically, this applies to AI models that have undergone exceptionally advanced and extensive training using a lot of cutting-edge computing resources – in technical terms, model weights...

Content: # US AI Chip Export Curbs: Navigating Geopolitical Risks and Supply Chain Opportunities in Southeast AsiaRhys NorthwoodFriday, Jul 4, 2025 3:08 pm ET3min read

The U.S. imposition of export curbs on advanced AI chips to Malaysia and Thailand marks a pivotal moment in the global semiconductor arms race. These restrictions, aimed at curbing China's access to critical AI infrastructure, are reshaping supply chains and creating both risks and opportunities for investors. As geopolitical tensions redefine technology corridors, firms with diversified strategies and alignment to U.S. policy priorities stand to benefit, while those reliant on opaque Southeast Asian manufacturing face significant headwinds.

### Geopolitical Risks: A New Era of Semiconductor Control

The U.S. Tiered Export Controls framework—dubbed the “AI Diffusion Framework”—has reclassified Malaysia and Thailand as

**Tier 2 countries**, subject to stringent controls on advanced AI chips (e.g., NVIDIA's H100, AMD's MI300X). The goal is to prevent t...

Title: Electricity price by country 2024 | Statista
URL: https://www.statista.com/statistics/263492/electricity-prices-in-selected-countries/
Content: Germany, Belgium, and Ireland had some of the highest household electricity prices worldwide, as of June 2024. At the time, German households were charged around 0.39 U.S. dollars per kilowatt-hour, while in Belgium, the price stood at 0.37 U.S. dollars per kilowatt-hour. By comparison, in Qatar, residents paid more than 10 times less.

## What is behind electricity prices?

Electricity prices vary widely across the world and sometimes even within a country itself, depending on factors like infrastructure, geography, and politically determined taxes and levies. For example, in Denmark, Belgium, and Sweden, taxes constitute a significant portion of residential end-user electricity prices.

## Reliance on fossil fuel imports

Meanwhile, thanks to their great crude oil and natural gas production output, countries like Iran, Qatar, and Russia enjoy some of the cheapest electricity prices in the world. Here, the average household pays less than 0.1 U.S. dollars per kilowatt-hour. In contrast, countries heavily rel...

Title: Cost of Electricity by Country 2025
URL: https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/cost-of-electricity-by-country
Content: Italians pay an average of $0.457 per kilowatt hour for electricity. Italy generates roughly 50% of its electricity from the burning of natural gas. Because of this, the price of electricity can be quite volatile, impacted greatly by fluctuations in the price of natural gas. For example, even the government-regulated price of electricity, which impacts 41% of the country’s households, fell by 19% in Q1 2022 and rose by 58% in Q4 2022.

Belgians pay just over $0.365 USD for every kilowatt-hour of electricity they consume, as of 2024. While a good portion of this cost is related to taxes, Belgium’s geographical location makes it reliant on neighboring countries for much of its electricity production, which amplifies the cost of electricity.

Residents of Bermuda pay an average of $0.458 per kilowatt-hour of electricity. One of the smallest countries in the world, Bermuda has a tiny land area of roughly 53.2 km² (20.5 mi²) with a population of more than 65,000 residents. As such, the country lacks the space nece...

Content: # China’s Industrial Power Rates 2025: A Guide for Investors

**China’s industrial power rates depend upon the category of industry, type of electricity usage, region where it is located, time of use, as well as** *the charging* ** method that the company chooses to go along with. In this article, we offer a rundown of how the industrial power rates are fixed in the country. **

The cost of electricity consumption is a critical factor for businesses in the industrial sector, particularly in energy-intensive industries like iron, steel, non-ferrous metals, building materials, chemicals, and advanced manufacturing. As China moves up the value chain in manufacturing higher-technology products, it actively seeks to reduce costs and has implemented measures to lower general industrial power rates.

Over the past few years, the average industrial power rate in China has increased slightly, reaching approximately US$0.088/kWh in 2024, up from US$0.084/kWh in 2019. Despite this uptick, China’s electricity prices rema...

### Asia’s energy transition is gaining momentum; meeting electricity demand growth with clean power is now key

Anchor point: Overview

## Highlights

### 34% of Asia’s electricity was generated from clean sources last year, below the global average of 41%.

Asia is home to 83% of the world’s coal generation. However, clean electricity investment is now significantly outweighing fossil fuel investment in the region, and growth in coal generation is slowing down.

Asia started its electricity transition later than other regions, but is catching up fast. The share of solar and wind in Asia is now almost the same as the world average, and the share of renewables in Asia’s electricity mix reached 29% in 2024. China and India, two of the world’s top five absolute generators of wind and solar are in Asia, and the share of wind and solar is growing in Asian countries’ electricity mixes.

While most Asian countries have set long-term energy transition targets, many lack immediate plans for rapid transformati...

Country-level variations in Southeast Asia’s power sector are pronounced, with diverse
energy resources, population density, geographical topography, development goals and the
availability of clean energy investments. Myanmar and Viet Nam, for instance, have large
wind potential, while Lao PDR and Cambodia hold significant hydro potential.
In contrast, Singapore is emerging as a significant economic hub despite its limited natural
resources, relying on regional grid connectivity for clean energy imports to meet increasing
electricity demand. Currently Singapore aims to import up to 6 GW of low carbon electricity
by 2035, positioning the country to nearly meet the IEA’s target of 8.1 GW low carbon
electricity import by 2035.
All ASEAN countries are forecasting electricity demand growth through 2030, with annual
growth projections ranging from 1.8% to 19%.
Myanmar is expected to see the largest increase, with electricity demand projected to reach
57 TWh by 2030, up from 17 TWh in 2023. Viet Nam and Cambodia ...

GLOBAL ENERGY MONITOR
At the same time, however, continued support for gas and coal, regulatory hur-
dles, and policies unsupportive of renewable energy buildout are stymying the 
rapid transition that is necessary to break the region’s dependence on gas and coal 
and progress renewable energy in ASEAN countries. While the region has poten-
tial to increase its renewables capacity seven-fold — this report documents over 
220 GW of documented prospective3 utility-scale solar and wind capacity — only 
3% of ASEAN countries’ total prospective capacity is currently in construction. 
The global average, barring China, is over twice that of ASEAN countries, at 7% 
prospective capacity under construction.
Key findings

ASEAN countries have over 28 GW of operating utility-scale solar and wind 
capacity and a 20% increase in operating capacity since January 2023 and 
make up 9% of ASEAN countries’ total electrical capacity.

to increase by an average of 6.5% / 
year from 2024 – 2026, requiring an 
extra 80 GW of thermal capacity over 
the upcoming decade.  Although coal 
remains the primary source of generation, 
its contribution to the electricity mix is 
predicted to decline from 74% in 2023 to 
68% by 2026, in contrast to renewable 
generation, which is expected to rise 
from 21% to constitute 25% of the total

Since October 2022, the United States has devoted significant resources to restricting China’s access to artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced semiconductor technologies. In the final months of the Biden administration, the Department of Commerce issued four additional far-reaching export control updates. On December 2, 2024, it released two rules that added 140 companies to the Entity List, expanded the scope of the Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR), and restricted new technology areas such as high-bandwidth memory, among other measures. In the second week of January 2025, the Department of Commerce issued the AI Diffusion Framework and the Foundry Due Diligence Rule, further shaping the spread of AI and semiconductor technologies throughout the world. Export controls remain front and center for the second Trump administration, which directed an effort to “identify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls—especially those that enable the transfer of strategic goods, soft...

*Bloomberg*.

A preliminary version of the new export rule, reported by

*Bloomberg,* states that the U.S. Commerce Department would require companies to obtain a U.S. government export license before sending AI GPUs to the two Southeast Asian nations. The plan has not been finalized and may change, yet it may represent another step towards limiting Chinese entities' access to high-performance Nvidia AI GPUs.

Malaysia and Thailand are not major suspected hubs for the smuggling of Nvidia's GPUs, unlike Singapore, which is officially listed as one of Nvidia's primary sources of revenue, raising questions about whether the products sold to Singapore-based entities eventually end up in China.

The U.S. imposition of export curbs on advanced AI chips to Malaysia and Thailand marks a pivotal moment in the global semiconductor arms race. These restrictions, aimed at curbing China's access to critical AI infrastructure, are reshaping supply chains and creating both risks and opportunities for investors. As geopolitical tensions redefine technology corridors, firms with diversified strategies and alignment to U.S. policy priorities stand to benefit, while those reliant on opaque Southeast Asian manufacturing face significant headwinds.

Content: Italians pay an average of $0.457 per kilowatt hour for electricity. Italy generates roughly 50% of its electricity from the burning of natural gas. Because of this, the price of electricity can be quite volatile, impacted greatly by fluctuations in the price of natural gas. For example, even the government-regulated price of electricity, which impacts 41% of the country’s households, fell by 19% in Q1 2022 and rose by 58% in Q4 2022.

Belgians pay just over $0.365 USD for every kilowatt-hour of electricity they consume, as of 2024. While a good portion of this cost is related to taxes, Belgium’s geographical location makes it reliant on neighboring countries for much of its electricity production, which amplifies the cost of electricity.

Residents of Bermuda pay an average of $0.458 per kilowatt-hour of electricity. One of the smallest countries in the world, Bermuda has a tiny land area of roughly 53.2 km² (20.5 mi²) with a population of more than 65,000 residents. As such, the country lacks the space nece...

Driven by rapid economic growth, industrialisation and urbanisation, the ASEAN energy demand is projected to increase. Fossil fuels remain a key component to meet the growing demand. Nevertheless, the region is fully committed to ensuring an inclusive energy transition. In balancing the low carbon transition with energy security and economic growth, the “low hanging fruit” efforts of energy efficiency are yet to be fully optimised. A shift to a cleaner supply is crucial not only to decarbonise the energy system but also to improve energy independence. Amidst these critical issues, AEO8 presents the latest overview of the ASEAN energy sector and assesses its key trends.

Content: The outlook for the nuclear power market varies depending on the region and country. In some countries, such as China, nuclear power is expected to continue to grow and be an important part of their energy mix. However, in other countries, such as Germany and Japan, there are plans to phase out nuclear power in the coming years. Additionally, the development of new nuclear power projects has been slow due to several factors, including safety concerns, public opposition, and high costs. The construction of new nuclear power plants has also faced delays and cost overruns. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has far-reaching effects on the nuclear market, as sanctions imposed on Russia cast doubts on the future of its nuclear industry in the global arena.

The fossil fuel energy market is expected to face significant challenges and changes in the coming years. While there is still significant demand for oil, natural gas, and coal, the industry is increasingly facing pressure from the growth of renewable energy source...

Title: Electricity price by country 2024 | Statista
URL: https://www.statista.com/statistics/263492/electricity-prices-in-selected-countries/
Content: Germany, Belgium, and Ireland had some of the highest household electricity prices worldwide, as of June 2024. At the time, German households were charged around 0.39 U.S. dollars per kilowatt-hour, while in Belgium, the price stood at 0.37 U.S. dollars per kilowatt-hour. By comparison, in Qatar, residents paid more than 10 times less.

## What is behind electricity prices?

Electricity prices vary widely across the world and sometimes even within a country itself, depending on factors like infrastructure, geography, and politically determined taxes and levies. For example, in Denmark, Belgium, and Sweden, taxes constitute a significant portion of residential end-user electricity prices.

## Reliance on fossil fuel imports

Meanwhile, thanks to their great crude oil and natural gas production output, countries like Iran, Qatar, and Russia enjoy some of the cheapest electricity prices in the world. Here, the average household pays less than 0.1 U.S. dollars per kilowatt-hour. In contrast, countries heavily rel...

Italy generates roughly 50% of its electricity from the burning of natural gas. Because of this, the price of electricity can be quite volatile, impacted greatly by fluctuations in the price of natural gas. For example, even the government-regulated price of electricity, which impacts 41% of the country’s households, fell by 19% in Q1 2022 and rose by 58% in Q4 2022.\n\nBelgians pay just over $0.365 USD for every kilowatt-hour of electricity they consume, as of 2024. While a good portion of this cost is related to taxes, Belgium’s geographical location makes it reliant on neighboring countries for much of its electricity production, which amplifies the cost of electricity.\n\nResidents of Bermuda pay an average of $0.458 per kilowatt-hour of electricity. One of the smallest countries in the world, Bermuda has a tiny land area of roughly 53.2 km² (20.5 mi²) with a population of more than 65,000 residents.

Driven by rapid economic growth, industrialisation and urbanisation, the ASEAN energy demand is projected to increase. Fossil fuels remain a key component to meet the growing demand. Nevertheless, the region is fully committed to ensuring an inclusive energy transition. In balancing the low carbon transition with energy security and economic growth, the “low hanging fruit” efforts of energy efficiency are yet to be fully optimised. A shift to a cleaner supply is crucial not only to decarbonise the energy system but also to improve energy independence. Amidst these critical issues, AEO8 presents the latest overview of the ASEAN energy sector and assesses its key trends. The report starts exploring the pathways of the energy sector through the Baseline Scenario (BAS) and AMS Targets Scenario (ATS).... The previous APAEC Targets Scenario (APS) in AEO7 is now escalated with enhanced constraints and least-cost optimisation in the power ...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 4:\nTitle: Energy - Southeast Asia | Statista Market Forecast\nURL: https://www.statista.com/outlook/io/energy/southeast-asia\nContent: The outlook for the nuclear power market varies depending on the region and country. In some countries, such as China, nuclear power is expected to continue to grow and be an important part of their energy mix. However, in other countries, such as Germany and Japan, there are plans to phase out nuclear power in the coming years. Additionally, the development of new nuclear power projects has been slow due to several factors, including safety concerns, public opposition, and high costs. The construction of new nuclear power plants has also faced delays and cost overruns. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has far-reaching effects on the nuclear market, as sanctions imposed on Russia cast doubts on the future of its nuclear industry in the global arena.\n\nThe fossil fuel energy market is expected to face significant challenges and changes in the coming years. While there is still significant demand for oil, natural gas, and coal, the industry is increasingly facing pressure from the growth of renewable energy source...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 5:\nTitle: Southeast Asia Energy Outlook 2024\nURL: https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/891cdae1-25c2-4193-95bd-fe82ebf845fd/SoutheastAsiaEnergyOutlook2024.pdf\nContent: which involves addressing inflexible contractual arrangements. Others are exploring co-firing coal plants with low-emissions fuels like biomass and ammonia. By incorporating more cost-competitive sources into the mix, the average cost of electricity decreases from around USD 120 per MWh today – above the global average – to just under USD 100 per MWh by 2035 and to USD 80 per MWh by 2050. Expanding and modernising electricity grids, including enhancing regional interconnections, is essential for ensuring electricity security and flexibility. By 2035, annual investment needs for electricity networks more than double to around USD 22 billion in the STEPS. This includes infrastructure investments tied to regional initiatives such as the ASEAN Power Grid, which aims to connect all 10 ASEAN countries, and the power trade agreement among the six countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion, as well as renewables-based microgrids for remote areas and islands. Today’s electricity systems can accommodate higher shares of...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 6:\nTitle: ASEAN Rates November 2024 - Final | PDF | Electric Power\nURL: https://www.scribd.com/document/830410915/ASEAN-Rates-November-2024-final\nContent: ASEAN Rates November 2024 - Final\n\nAI-enhanced title and description\n\nASEAN\n\nNovember 2024\n\n13.87 14.00 12.49 12.62 12.06 12.00 11.08\n\n10.00 9.33 8.89 8.67 8.39 Php/kWh\n\n- BN CM ID LAO MM MY PH SG TH VN Residential 5.25 8.89 5.35 2.36 6.81 8.39 12.49 13.87 7.56 7.06 Commercial 2.62 9.33 3.83 2.51 2.36 3.50 11.08 12.62 5.37 3.82 Industrial 2.62 8.67 3.83 1.92 5.82 3.50 7.66 12.06 5.36 6.09\n\n• Brunei Darussalam (BN) – Department of Electrical Services, Effective • Malaysia (MY) – Tenaga Nasional Berhad, Effective since April 2018 since January 2012 • Myanmar (MM)- Ministry of Electricity and Energy, Effective since September 2024• Cambodia (CM)- Electricity Authority of Cambodia (EAC), Effective since • Philippines (PH) – MERALCO, Effective November 2024 January 2019 • Singapore (SG) – Singapore Power, Effective November 2024, updated quarterly• Indonesia (ID) – Perusahaan Listrik Negara, Effective since March 2024 • Thailand (TH)– Metropolitan Electricity Authority, Effective since January 2023• Laos PDR (LAO)...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 7:\nTitle: Electricity market designs\nURL: https://caseforsea.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/EN-Electricity-Market-Designs-in-Southeast-Asia.pdf\nContent: in Southeast Asia \nHarnessing opportunities for renewable \nenergy growth in Indonesia, Thailand,\nViet Nam, and the Philippines... electricity, clean generation profiles and insula\xad\ntion from international market swings in fossil fuel \nprices. \nThis report assesses market and regulatory barri\xad\ners to variable renewable energy investment and \nsystem integration in four of the region’s leading \neconomies – Indonesia, Thailand, Viet Nam \nThese objectives, or pillars, for renewables-\nready power systems interact.

Title: US Implements New Export Controls Targeting Advanced Semiconductor Technology
URL: https://supplychainreport.org/us-implements-new-export/
Content: The United States has announced a new wave of export controls designed to limit the ability of certain countries to develop advanced semiconductor technologies. These measures, part of ongoing efforts to regulate critical industries, focus on curbing the export of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and semiconductor manufacturing tools.

The updated restrictions will apply to U.S.-based companies and foreign firms using American technology. The rules aim to address concerns over advanced chips used in artificial intelligence and related fields.

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo described the measures as “groundbreaking and comprehensive,” noting their intended impact on the production of cutting-edge chips globally.

**Key Aspects of the New Export Controls**: **Expansion of Restricted Technologies**: The rules now encompass 24 additional types of chipmaking tools, broadening the scope of earlier restrictions. **Extraterritorial Reach**: The Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR) will be applied to non-U.S. entities usi...

URL: https://www.benzinga.com/government/24/11/41726213/applied-materials-and-lam-research-shift-supply-chains-away-from-china-to-meet-new-us-guidelines
Content: The U.S. semiconductor industry is intensifying efforts to exclude Chinese firms from its supply chains, following Washington's directives to reduce China's involvement in critical next-generation technologies. Prominent chip equipment makers, such as Applied Materials Inc AMAT and Lam Research Inc LRCX, have informed suppliers that they must find non-Chinese alternatives for specific components or risk losing their supplier status. This requirement also extends to barring suppliers with Chinese investors or shareholders from continuing business partnerships with these companies, the Wall Street Journal reports. Industry experts indicate that shifting to non-Chinese suppliers will likely increase chipmakers' costs, as alternatives may be limited or more expensive. While Lam Research confirmed that it complies with U.S. export restrictions for chip-related supply chains, Applied Materials highlighted its efforts to source alternative components to ensure stable supply, especially as China remains one of its bi...

- October 2023: The United States updates its semiconductor export controls to close several loopholes that weakened the efficacy of the original rules.

- October 2023: China announces export restrictions of graphite, a key input in electric vehicle batteries. China is the world’s number one graphite producer and refines more than 90 percent of global graphite.

- May 2024: China announces a $47.5 billion investment fund to bolster its domestic semiconductor capacity. The fund represents China’s third round of state-led investment in its semiconductor industry in the last decade.

**The Impact of Export Controls on U.S. Companies**

It is well recognized that export controls can have an adverse effect on the implementer. Export controls deny affected firms in the implementing country economic opportunities that the market would otherwise allow. Thus, the United States must als...

Content: ### Available Downloads

An initial assessment of recent attempts by the United States to limit or delay China’s ability to acquire and produce advanced semiconductor technologies reveals a mixed picture in a complex and rapidly evolving industry. On the one hand, new chip restrictions have significantly affected China’s semiconductor ecosystem, limiting access to equipment essential for next-generation production. On the other hand, China is intensifying its domestic investments in more advanced chips while also reducing market shares of U.S. firms—and by extension, the revenues U.S. firms need to invest in the next-generation of technology. Over time, this loss of market share could well undermine the competitiveness of U.S. firms in this key industry. The initial volley of restrictions has also revealed limitations of export controls, both because the technology is rapidly changing and because there are gaps in compliance between U.S. companies and those of allies.

One key conclusion, however, is that the...

Title: U.S. Semiconductor Equipment Makers Scramble to Find Alternatives to Chinese Suppliers Amid Growing Restrictions
URL: https://www.ic-pcb.com/us-semiconductor-equipment-makers-scramble-to-find-alternatives-to-chinese-suppliers-amid-growing-restrictions.html
Content: As the U.S. ramps up its efforts to curb China's access to advanced semiconductor technologies, major U.S.-based chip equipment manufacturers, including Applied Materials and Lam Research, are urging their suppliers to find alternatives to Chinese-made components. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the companies have warned their suppliers that continued reliance on Chinese components could jeopardize their vendor status. Additionally, suppliers have been instructed to avoid Chinese investors or shareholders.

This move comes as part of the U.S. government's ongoing crackdown on China's access to cutting-edge semiconductor technology, which has significantly impacted global supply chains. Despite no official agreements, sources indicate that Applied Materials and Lam Research have verbally communicated these guidelines to their suppliers, emphasizing the need to source components from non-Chinese suppliers. Industry executives have acknowledged that finding comparable alternatives could raise costs, a...

The rules aim to address concerns over advanced chips used in artificial intelligence and related fields.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo described the measures as “groundbreaking and comprehensive,” noting their intended impact on the production of cutting-edge chips globally.\n\n**Key Aspects of the New Export Controls**: **Expansion of Restricted Technologies**: The rules now encompass 24 additional types of chipmaking tools, broadening the scope of earlier restrictions. **Extraterritorial Reach**: The Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR) will be applied to non-U.S. entities usi...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 2:\nTitle: Applied Materials and Lam Research Shift Supply Chains Away from China to Meet New US Guidelines\nURL: https://www.benzinga.com/government/24/11/41726213/applied-materials-and-lam-research-shift-supply-chains-away-from-china-to-meet-new-us-guidelines\nContent: The U.S. semiconductor industry is intensifying efforts to exclude Chinese firms from its supply chains, following Washington's directives to reduce China's involvement in critical next-generation technologies. Prominent chip equipment makers, such as Applied Materials Inc AMAT and Lam Research Inc LRCX, have informed suppliers that they must find non-Chinese alternatives for specific components or risk losing their supplier status. This requirement also extends to barring suppliers with Chinese investors or shareholders from continuing business partnerships with these companies, the Wall Street Journal reports. Industry experts indicate that shifting to non-Chinese suppliers will likely increase chipmakers' costs, as alternatives may be limited or more expensive. While Lam Research confirmed that it complies with U.S. export restrictions for chip-related supply chains, Applied Materials highlighted its efforts to source alternative components to ensure stable supply, especially as China remains one of its bi...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 3:\nTitle: Collateral Damage: The Domestic Impact of U.S. Semiconductor ...\nURL: https://www.csis.org/analysis/collateral-damage-domestic-impact-us-semiconductor-export-controls\nContent: - July 2023: Japan updates export controls for high-performance SME, requiring government licenses to export the SME to any country.\n\n- October 2023: The United States updates its semiconductor export controls to close several loopholes that weakened the efficacy of the original rules.\n\n- October 2023: China announces export restrictions of graphite, a key input in electric vehicle batteries.

According to a Wall Street Journal report, the companies have warned their suppliers that continued reliance on Chinese components could jeopardize their vendor status. Additionally, suppliers have been instructed to avoid Chinese investors or shareholders.\n\nThis move comes as part of the U.S. government's ongoing crackdown on China's access to cutting-edge semiconductor technology, which has significantly impacted global supply chains. Despite no official agreements, sources indicate that Applied Materials and Lam Research have verbally communicated these guidelines to their suppliers, emphasizing the need to source components from non-Chinese suppliers.

Title: Taiwan puts companies behind China's AI ambitions on export control list
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/16/tech/taiwan-china-huawei-smic-export-control-intl-hnk
Content: Taiwan has recently included China's tech giant Huawei and the semiconductor powerhouse Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) on its export control roster, intensifying its efforts to synchronize with the United States' crackdown on firms bolstering Beijing's ambitions in artificial intelligence.

Last week, Taiwan's International Trade Administration revised its list of strategic high-tech commodities entities, citing "concerns regarding weapons proliferation and national security." This update added Huawei and SMIC along with hundreds of other entities from China, Myanmar, Russia, Iran, and Pakistan. As per the new regulations, Taiwanese companies will need to obtain permits prior to exporting to the identified firms.

This regulatory change comes amid rising tensions between the US and China over advanced technologies such as semiconductors and AI. The US has expressed growing apprehension about its technology being utilized for military purposes by China. Just last month, the Trump ...

Content: Further, the export controls may deter the formation of relationships between U.S. firms and firms in countries other than China for the same reasons. Rather than rely on U.S. firms over the long term, these third-party firms may prefer to identify sources of supply that are less likely to burden them with future restrictions. The New York Fed’s report indicated this may be the case, as it found that affected U.S. firms were not establishing new relationships with firms located in allied nations either.

The potential lost revenue could have a considerable impact on the U.S. semiconductor industry, as it undermines the economies of scale that the industry depends on. Given the huge up-front costs in semiconductor manufacturing—U.S. semiconductor firms spent nearly $50 billion on capital in 2022 alone—firms must maximize their sales to recoup their investment and remain price competitive.

### Ascend 910D coming in May, 2025, may compete favorably with H100.

Good Morning,

I’ve been thinking a lot again about the efficacy of U.S. export controls around AI chips to China. Requiring Nvidia’s H20s to have a license is almost like funding China’s SMIC and Huawei duo to accelerate their own chip development.

China’s Huawei Technologies is preparing to test its newest and most powerful artificial intelligence (AI) processor as a replacement for Nvidia’s H20s chip.

Nvidia said in mid April that it will take a quarterly charge of about $5.5 billion tied to exporting H20 graphics processing units to China and other destinations. China of course wants a home grown AI chip to replace it and Huawei has approached some Chinese tech companies about testing the technical feasibility of the new chip, called the Ascend 910D.

According to the recent WSJ report, the OEM is reaching major Chinese tech firms to analyze the technical value of the
