Content: # ASML Projects €60bn Revenue on AI Chip Demand: Explained

The global surge in AI applications has created mass demand for advanced semiconductors, placing ASML, one of Europe's largest technology companies by market value, at the centre of the AI computing revolution.

The company's lithography machines, which cost up to €350m per unit, are essential for manufacturing the high-performance chips that power AI systems.

These machines use precise beams of light to etch microscopic patterns onto silicon wafers, creating the intricate circuits that form modern computer chips.

The complexity and precision of this process makes ASML's technology indispensable for semiconductor manufacturers, as no other company can produce comparable equipment at scale.

As a result, ASML expects sales growth between 8% and 14% over the next five years, as demand for AI chips drives investment in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

The company projects its annual revenue could reach €60bn by 2030, supported by increasing req...

Content: The company's backlog, a key leading indicator, remains robust at €38 billion as of Q1 2025, driven by orders for its next-gen High-NA EUV systems (EXE:5200), which began shipping in Q2 2025. These machines enable 3nm and smaller nodes, critical for AI accelerators and HPC servers. While EUV sales dipped to 38% of net system sales in 2024 (from 42% in 2023), the decline reflects a temporary pause in customer capacity expansions. With hyperscalers likeAmazon, Google, and Meta racing to build AI data centers, demand for EUV is set to rebound. ASML's CEO, Christophe Fouquet, recently stated: “AI is spurring growth and shifting market dynamics… the logic segment will lead growth in 2025.”

Content: # ASML’s AI Strategy: Enduring Dominance in the AI Era of Semiconductors

The report explores how ASML’s ai strategy will dominate in AI. The report includes the most exhaustive ai strategy analysis complete with references and works cited by Dany Kitishian of Klover.AI.

# ASML AI Executive Summary

The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a fundamental shift in technological paradigms, driven by an insatiable demand for computational power. While market attention often focuses on AI model developers like OpenAI or hardware designers like NVIDIA, this report posits that the ultimate, structural dominance in the AI era belongs to a less visible, yet more critical, entity: ASML Holding N.V. This analysis argues that ASML’s dominance is not merely a consequence of its current market leadership but a structural certainty, cemented by its monopolistic control over the foundational manufacturing technology that paces the entire AI hardware ecosystem.

Content: # Arm's AI Ambitions vs. Margin Pressures: Is the Stock Overvalued for the Long Game?Written byRhys Northwood

- Arm Holdings leverages hyperscaler partnerships (AWS, NVIDIA, Google) and AI-optimized architectures to position itself as a foundational player in the AI semiconductor ecosystem.

- Despite 96.98% gross margins and 55% operating margins, its 85.2X forward P/E ratio raises valuation concerns amid rising R&D costs ($2.071B in 2025) and industry cyclicality risks.

- The company's indirect IP licensing model faces execution risks from RISC-V competition and hyperscaler in-house shifts, contrasting with peers like NVIDIA (45X P/E) that directly monetize AI chips.

- Investors must balance Arm's 23% YoY royalty growth and $173.7B market cap against margin pressures, R&D efficiency, and ecosystem scalability through partners like NVIDIA's Blackwell and AWS's Graviton4.

In the high-stakes arena of AI-driven semiconductor innovation,Arm Holdings (ARM) stands at a crossroads. Its ambitious roadmap—anchore...

These trends drive the replacement of traditional mechanical equipment by smart, energy-saving and connected 
electronic equipment using various sensors, processors, connectivity, analog and security chipsets that align well 
with NXP’s portfolio and ability to provide customers with system solutions across these applications segments. 
Finally, with the growing number of connected devices and increasing data generation, latency, privacy and 
bandwidth have become critical limiting factors. Intelligent edge solutions solve this by bringing the intelligence 
closer to the source. Edge systems reduce the tendency on the cloud, lowering power consumption, strengthening 
data protection. They are, most of the time, autonomous and real-time. They handle data and do decisions 
locally. NXP's scalable low power solutions across the entire embedded processing spectrum are ideally suited

Content: Year-on-year performance was a result of flattish revenue, combined with better gross margin offset by higher operating expenses. Now, let me turn to the specific trends in our focus end markets. In automotive, quarter one revenue was $1.83 billion, up 17% versus the year ago period and above the midpoint of our guidance. In Industrial & IoT, quarter one revenue was $504 million, down 26% versus the year ago period and near the high end of our guidance. In mobile, quarter one revenue was $260 million, down 35% versus the year ago period and near the high-end of our guidance. And finally, Communication Infrastructure and Other, quarter one revenue was $529 million, up 7% year-on-year and above the midpoint of our guidance. During that first quarter, after a slow start, we have seen modest incremental improvement in our China-exposed businesses, which are primarily served through the distribution channel.

Title: Melexis Earnings: Auto Chip Shortage Continues; Supply/Demand Could Balance by End-2023
URL: https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/melexis-earnings-auto-chip-shortage-continues-supplydemand-could-balance-by-end-2023
Content: Narrow-moat Melexis MELE met all of its guidance metrics in the first quarter of 2023, with sales up 22% organically to EUR 229 million (guidance EUR 225 million-EUR 230 million), gross margin at 45% (in line with guidance), and an operating margin of 26.7% (guidance of 26%). However, shares are down by almost 5% at the time of the writing; we believe this is explained by a major correction in the semiconductor sector. Dutch equipment-maker ASM International is down by 10% after booking weaker-than-expected new orders, while ASML is down by 2%. We have also seen how other U.S. stocks have corrected in the past three weeks as the industry continues to absorb higher inventories. However, automotive semiconductors are at a different stage in the cycle than smartphones and PCs, as there is still a shortage of automotive chips. The automotive chip shortage could start to ease in the late part of 2023 as supply continues to increase and demand normalizes, based on comments from Melexis’ management and also comments...

Title: Melexis Earnings: Strong Sales and Gross Margins; Auto Chip Supplies Keeps Improving
URL: https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/melexis-earnings-strong-sales-gross-margins-auto-chip-supplies-keeps-improving
Content: Melexis’ MELE second-quarter results are not surprising given several auto chip companies have already reported healthy results. Demand for auto chips remains steady and the chip shortage is improving. Second-quarter sales were EUR 237 million, at the higher end of the guided range, up 14% year over year and 4% sequentially. For the third quarter management expects sales to grow more than 4% sequentially (at the midpoint of third-quarter guidance). Management also upgraded its full-year guidance targets given the strong performance in the first half and expects a good performance for the remainder of 2023; it now expects sales to be up between 14% and 16% (previously 11% to 16%) with a gross profit margin above 45% and an operating margin of 27% (26% previously). We maintain our EUR 105 fair value estimate and see the shares as fairly valued as of Aug. 2.... The second-quarter gross margin benefited from price increases at the beginning of the year and cheaper wafer costs; however, this should normalize in th...

Content: In the evening hours of Wednesday, Arm Holdings disclosed non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $0.36 for the final quarter of its 2023-24 fiscal year, marking a significant improvement from the $0.02 reported in the previous year's last quarter. The company's adjusted operating margin also saw a substantial shift, rising to 42.1% compared to the negative 0.2% recorded in the last quarter of 2022-23.

Revenues for the British chip designer reached an impressive $928 million, representing a 47% increase year-on-year. Specifically, royalties and licensing revenues experienced growth of 37% and 60% respectively, attributable to heightened corporate investment in artificial intelligence (AI).

CEO Rene Haas commented on the trend, stating, "Artificial intelligence (AI) is fueling heightened demand for our technologies in all market sectors. From the cloud to the edge, all AI software models, including GPT and Llama, are built upon and operate using the Arm computing platform."

Title: Arm Holdings Q4 2023: AI Tailwinds Just Started
URL: https://tamalroy.substack.com/p/arm-holdings-q4-2023-ai-tailwinds
Content: ### The stock jumped 50%

In an impressive display of financial performance, Arm Holdings has announced its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023, causing its stock to surge by 50% due to optimistic guidance for 2024 and business outlook in AI tailwinds. This surge underscores the market’s confidence in Arm’s business model and its pivotal role in the semiconductor industry.

**Arm’s Business Model: A Blueprint for Success**

At the heart of Arm Holdings’ success is a unique business model that eschews traditional semiconductor manufacturing in favor of designing semiconductor architectures. These designs are then licensed to tech giants like Apple, which, in turn, engage manufacturers such as TSMC to bring them to life in their devices. This model allows Arm to earn substantial licensing fees and royalties, positioning it as a linchpin in the tech ecosystem.

Arm’s designs, based on its proprietary architecture, compete directly with the x86 architecture used by Intel. However, Arm has successfully carved ...

Content: According to NXP Semiconductors's latest financial reports and stock price the company's current Operating Margin is 25.91%. At the end of 2024 the company had an Operating Margin of 24.57%.

The operating margin is a key indicator to assess the profitability of a company. Higher operating margins are generaly better as they show that a company is able to sell its products or services for much more than their production costs. The operating margin is calculated by dividing a company's earnings by its revenue.

The market capitalization sometimes referred as Marketcap, is the value of a publicly listed company.

In most cases it can be easily calculated by multiplying the share price with the amount of outstanding shares.

Content: Today, Infineon Technologies AG is reporting results for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year, both of which ended on 30 September 2023.

“In the 2023 fiscal year, Infineon has set new records for revenue and profitability. The results are an initial confirmation of our more ambitious course we embarked on as a company a year ago,” says Jochen Hanebeck, CEO of Infineon.

“Nevertheless, we find ourselves in an environment that continues to present challenges. We are seeing different trends in our target markets. Structural semiconductor growth in the areas of renewable energy, electromobility – especially in China – and microcontrollers for the automotive industry remains unabated. In contrast, consumer, communication, computing and IoT applications are experiencing a temporary period of low demand. Overall, we are expecting revenue growth to continue in the 2024 fiscal year but at a slower rate. We are reacting decisively to the market situation.

Title: Infineon Lifts Sales Guidance After Boost From AI Chips — Update
URL: https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202502041755/infineon-lifts-sales-guidance-after-boost-from-ai-chips-update
Content: By Mauro Orru

Infineon Technologies raised its sales forecasts for the fiscal year amid solid demand for chips to power servers and data centers behind the artificial-intelligence boom.

The German chip maker said revenue would be flat to slightly up in the year to the end of September from the 14.96 billion euros ($15.94 billion) it reported for fiscal 2024. Infineon had previously forecast a slight decline. Meanwhile, Infineon's segment result margin--a key profitability measure--is still expected in the mid-to-high-teens percentage range.

The upgrade comes after what Infineon said was a slightly better start to the fiscal year than expected amid a boost in semiconductors sales for servers and data centers to power AI. However, areas of the semiconductor industry outside of artificial intelligence continue to suffer from sluggish demand.

Content: # Infineon bets on AI boom to spur more lucrative chip sales

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's Infineon is banking on a boom in artificial intelligence (AI) to generate billions in revenue and drive future growth by selling higher price chips, CEO Jochen Hanebeck said on Friday.

Published on 02/23/2024 at 05:18 am EST

"Conventional servers contain power semiconductors worth between $65-80. In an AI server, it's 850 to 1,800 US dollars, depending on the architecture," he told the company's annual general meeting, according to prepared remarks.

"With semiconductors for data centres, we expect to generate revenues in the low three-digit million euros range in the 2024 fiscal year. But in a few years' time, we expect annual revenues of around one billion euros." In the 2022/2023 financial year, Infineon presented record results, but scaled back its targets for 2023/2024 due to the weakening global economy.

Title: Melexis Earnings: Strong Sales and Gross Margins; Auto Chip Supplies Keeps Improving
URL: https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/melexis-earnings-strong-sales-gross-margins-auto-chip-supplies-keeps-improving
Content: Melexis’ MELE second-quarter results are not surprising given several auto chip companies have already reported healthy results. Demand for auto chips remains steady and the chip shortage is improving. Second-quarter sales were EUR 237 million, at the higher end of the guided range, up 14% year over year and 4% sequentially. For the third quarter management expects sales to grow more than 4% sequentially (at the midpoint of third-quarter guidance). Management also upgraded its full-year guidance targets given the strong performance in the first half and expects a good performance for the remainder of 2023; it now expects sales to be up between 14% and 16% (previously 11% to 16%) with a gross profit margin above 45% and an operating margin of 27% (26% previously). We maintain our EUR 105 fair value estimate and see the shares as fairly valued as of Aug. 2.... The second-quarter gross margin benefited from price increases at the beginning of the year and cheaper wafer costs; however, this should normalize in th...

Content: Zooming out, Melexis has been climbing steadily since 2019, except for a quick stumble in 2020, reaching a gross margin of 45.65% by 2023. Revenue? Oh, it’s been growing like a champ—11% annually since 2018, beating many competitors. For example, Qualcomm saw a 12% revenue dip from FY 2022 to FY 2024, and MTG dropped 7% from FY 2023 to FY 2024 (though they had a wild 32% boost the year before).

Bottom line? Melexis is steadily growing revenue and bouncing back on margins, proving they’ve got the stamina to stay in the game—and that’s no small feat in the ever-shifting world of semiconductors! For the visual people, a graphical representation:

**Innovation at Melexis**

Now let’s dive into another key strength of Melexis: innovation. It’s their secret sauce for staying ahead of the competition and a major selling point for investors. They achieve this by (1) focusing on cutting-edge chip design and (2) recruiting top-notch talent.

Content: Today, Infineon Technologies AG is reporting results for the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year, both of which ended on 30 September 2023.

“In the 2023 fiscal year, Infineon has set new records for revenue and profitability. The results are an initial confirmation of our more ambitious course we embarked on as a company a year ago,” says Jochen Hanebeck, CEO of Infineon.

“Nevertheless, we find ourselves in an environment that continues to present challenges. We are seeing different trends in our target markets. Structural semiconductor growth in the areas of renewable energy, electromobility – especially in China – and microcontrollers for the automotive industry remains unabated. In contrast, consumer, communication, computing and IoT applications are experiencing a temporary period of low demand. Overall, we are expecting revenue growth to continue in the 2024 fiscal year but at a slower rate. We are reacting decisively to the market situation.

and for the next 1.4nm node. We expect innovations 
such as back-side power delivery, widening adoption of 
metal ALD, and selective ALD to drive further increases

“AI has become the main driver of WFE

Memory sales fueled by HBM DRAM
Our memory business delivered a very strong 
performance in 2024. As a percentage of equipment 
sales, memory jumped from a relatively low level of 11% 
in 2023 to 25% in 2024. On the back of strong AI-related 
demand, DRAM customers stepped up their investment 
in high-bandwidth memory (HBM). The high-speed 
DRAM chips used in these HBM stacks require high-k 
metal gate ALD technology, in which ASM has a leading 
position. In other parts of the DRAM market, which 
depend more on the PC and smartphone segments, 
investment levels remained subdued. 
Sales of 3D-NAND approximately doubled, primarily for 
our advanced ALD gap-fill solutions. H...

Content: The gross margin of 51.8% and operating profit of €258.5 million further highlight operational discipline. A €34 million reversal of prior impairments on its stake in ASMPT (a reversal of a Q1 2025 loss) also skewed earnings positively. These metrics suggest that ASM's core business remains robust, even as order timing creates noise.

**Semiconductor Industry Dynamics: AI, Advanced Packaging, and Cyclical Risks**

The semiconductor industry's growth from 2023 to 2025 has been driven by generative AI and data center expansion, with AI-related chips accounting for over 20% of total chip sales in 2024. This has reshaped demand patterns, shifting focus from traditional logic and memory to advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration. For example, TSMC's CoWoS capacity is projected to double in 2025, a trend where ASM's ALD and epitaxy tools play a pivotal role.

However, the industry remains cyclical. Between 2023 and 2025, wafer shipments declined in 2023 but rebounded in 2025, while R&D spending hit 52% of ...

## Gate-all-around: a key growth driver for ASM

## As manufacturers have sought to scale FinFET transistors to smaller dimensions, new challenges –comparable in some ways to those of planar transistor scaling – have arisen. To solve these new scaling challenges, devices designers came up with gate-all-around (GAA) – or nanosheet – transistor architecture, which consists of the channel with the gate totally around it. In this new architecture, multiple nanosheets are used to enable the correct curre...

The operating margin is a key indicator to assess the profitability of a company. Higher operating margins are generaly better as they show that a company is able to sell its products or services for much more than their production costs. The operating margin is calculated by dividing a company's earnings by its revenue.

Content: One driver of industry sales has been the demand for gen AI chips: a mix of CPUs, GPUs, data center communications chips, memory, power chips, and more. Deloitte’s 2024 TMT Predictions report predicted that those gen AI chips collectively would be worth “more than” US$50 billion,

7 which was a much too conservative forecast, as the market was likely worth over US$125 billion in 2024—and represented over 20% of total chip sales for the year. 8 At the time of publication, we predict that gen AI chips will be over US$150 billion in 2025. 9 Further, Lisa Su, chief executive officer at AMD, moved her estimate for the total addressable market for AI accelerator chips up to US$500 billion in 2028—a number larger than sales for the entire chip industry in 2023. 10

In terms of end markets, after being flat at around 262 million units over 2023 and in 2024, PC sales are expected to grow in 2025 by over 4% to about 273 million units.

Deloitte’s 2024 TMT Predictions report predicted that those gen AI chips collectively would be worth “more than” US$50 billion,\n\n7 which was a much too conservative forecast, as the market was likely worth over US$125 billion in 2024—and represented over 20% of total chip sales for the year. 8 At the time of publication, we predict that gen AI chips will be over US$150 billion in 2025. 9 Further, Lisa Su, chief executive officer at AMD, moved her estimate for the total addressable market for AI accelerator chips up to US$500 billion in 2028—a number larger than sales for the entire chip industry in 2023. 10\n\nIn terms of end markets, after being flat at around 262 million units over 2023 and in 2024, PC sales are expected to grow in 2025 by over 4% to about 273 million units.\n\n11 Meanwhile, smartphone sales are expected to grow at low single digits in 2025 (an...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}

Content: During the year, we also expanded our cooperation with 
key logic/foundry customers for the sub-nodes of 2nm 
and for the next 1.4nm node. We expect innovations 
such as back-side power delivery, widening adoption of 
metal ALD, and selective ALD to drive further increases 
in ALD intensity. 
“AI has become the main driver of WFE 
spending.”
Memory sales fueled by HBM DRAM
Our memory business delivered a very strong 
performance in 2024. As a percentage of equipment 
sales, memory jumped from a relatively low level of 11% 
in 2023 to 25% in 2024. On the back of strong AI-related 
demand, DRAM customers stepped up their investment 
in high-bandwidth memory (HBM). The high-speed 
DRAM chips used in these HBM stacks require high-k 
metal gate ALD technology, in which ASM has a leading 
position. In other parts of the DRAM market, which 
depend more on the PC and smartphone segments, 
investment levels remained subdued. 
Sales of 3D-NAND approximately doubled, primarily for 
our advanced ALD gap-fill solutions. H...

URL: https://www.ainvest.com/news/asm-international-q2-order-strategic-reassessment-exposure-foundry-memory-cycles-2507/
Content: The gross margin of 51.8% and operating profit of €258.5 million further highlight operational discipline. A €34 million reversal of prior impairments on its stake in ASMPT (a reversal of a Q1 2025 loss) also skewed earnings positively. These metrics suggest that ASM's core business remains robust, even as order timing creates noise.

**Semiconductor Industry Dynamics: AI, Advanced Packaging, and Cyclical Risks**

The semiconductor industry's growth from 2023 to 2025 has been driven by generative AI and data center expansion, with AI-related chips accounting for over 20% of total chip sales in 2024. This has reshaped demand patterns, shifting focus from traditional logic and memory to advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration. For example, TSMC's CoWoS capacity is projected to double in 2025, a trend where ASM's ALD and epitaxy tools play a pivotal role.

However, the industry remains cyclical. Between 2023 and 2025, wafer shipments declined in 2023 but rebounded in 2025, while R&D spending hit 52% of ...

A €34 million reversal of prior impairments on its stake in ASMPT (a reversal of a Q1 2025 loss) also skewed earnings positively. These metrics suggest that ASM's core business remains robust, even as order timing creates noise.\n\n**Semiconductor Industry Dynamics: AI, Advanced Packaging, and Cyclical Risks**\n\nThe semiconductor industry's growth from 2023 to 2025 has been driven by generative AI and data center expansion, with AI-related chips accounting for over 20% of total chip sales in 2024. This has reshaped demand patterns, shifting focus from traditional logic and memory to advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration. For example, TSMC's CoWoS capacity is projected to double in 2025, a trend where ASM's ALD and epitaxy tools play a pivotal role.\n\nHowever, the industry remains cyclical.

URL: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1452234/telecom-company-orange-revenue-by-type/
Content: In 2023, the telecommunications company Orange generated around 11.4 billion euros in revenue just from its mobile services segment, making it the company's largest segment. Revenue from fixed services in the same year amounted to over nine billion euros. Although Orange generated significant revenues from its other segments such as IT services and equipment sales, the mobile and fixed-line segments remain the company's largest segments in terms of revenue. Overall, Orange generated over 44.1 billion euros in total revenue globally in 2023.

## How is Orange’s customer base faring?

Alongside these revenue figures, Orange’s customer base has also seen some interesting trends. The mobile subscriber count in its domestic market of France has shown a steady increase, rising from 33.1 million in 2018 to over 36.8 million in 2023. Furthermore, the company’s reach extended impressively in Africa and the Middle East, accounting for 149 million subscribers in the same year.

Content: # Our financial performance

In 2023, our revenues totaled €44,1 million, up 1.8% year-on-year¹. In Europe, our value strategy and price increases are bearing fruit. Revenue growth remains strong (+2.2% to 11.6 billion euros), driven by performances in Poland (+3.9%), Belgium and Luxembourg (+4.6%). Retail services revenues continue to grow (+3%). Growth in IT and integration services (+16%) and equipment sales (+11.1%) offset the drop in revenues from operator services (-8%). Spain, for the first time since 2018, reported a 1.1% increase in revenues.

In France, our value strategy took full effect in the 2nd half of 2023, with growth in retail services excluding PSTN (+3%) partially offsetting the expected decline in revenues from operator services (-8.5%). Revenues totaled €17.7 billion, down 1.4%.

The Africa and Middle East regions confirmed their excellent performance (+11.4%, to €7.2 billion), driven by mobile data (+17.7%), fixed broadband (+16.7%), Orange Money (+25.8%) and BtoB (+16.4%). Orange Busin...

URL: https://newsroom.orange.com/resultats-financiers-2023/
Content: Commenting on these results, Christel Heydemann, Orange’s Chief Executive Officer said:

“One year on from the announcement of our “Lead the Future” strategic plan, we have achieved all our financial targets for 2023. These results are a testament to our ability to execute and advance our major strategic projects.

Thanks to our work on pricing, our quality of service and our efficiency program, revenues and EBITDAaL grew 1.8% and 1.3% respectively, accelerating steadily throughout the year. As expected, in France, EBITDAaL improved markedly in the second half as our value strategy delivered its full effects. This strategy fueled growth in the consumer market supported by the quality of our network which has been ranked the best mobile network in France thirteen consecutive times by Arcep. Europe turned in a solid performance – driven by Spain which delivered year-on-year growth for the first time since 2018 – with a strong increase in EBITDAaL and with rankings amongst the best in terms of quality of service...

In 2023, our revenues totaled €44,1 million, up 1.8% year-on-year¹. In Europe, our value strategy and price increases are bearing fruit.

Content: Orange has outlined plans to leverage its data center assets as the French telco looks to capitalize on the growth around data center demand.

Michaël Trabbia, CEO of Orange Wholesale, noted last week at Mobile World Congress that data centers form a key segment of the carrier's telecoms infrastructure.

Trabbia stressed the importance of Orange owning its own telecoms infrastructure, during a time when many operators have sold some of their infrastructure assets, including towers and data centers.

"Owning infrastructure is only possible if you have the investment," Trabbia told a roundtable in Barcelona.

He explained that, through the operator's tower subsidiary Totem, Orange has been able to generate more revenue opportunities by opening up its towers to third parties.

Trabbia confirmed to

Title: The Limits of Chip Export Controls in Meeting the China ...
URL: https://www.csis.org/analysis/limits-chip-export-controls-meeting-china-challenge
Content: The U.S. government and those of its allies have imposed and progressively tightened controls on the export of semiconductor technology, devices, and tools to China in an effort to maintain U.S. leadership in this critical sector. China has responded with an all-out effort to stimulate domestic chip innovation capabilities and eliminate dependency on foreign sources. The outcome of the chip innovation race will determine which country leads in the development and application of AI, with major strategic and economic security implications.

Preventing China from acquiring the most advanced chip technology makes sense from a national security perspective, but export restrictions alone cannot substitute for comprehensive industrial and research policy measures necessary to ensure U.S. leadership in semiconductor design, production, and infrastructure. Moreover, the imposition of export controls has resulted in China doubling down on its existing deeply subsidized development efforts that could well produce breakt...

Content: ## New Rules Further Restrict China’s Access to Semiconductor Technology

On December 2, 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) issued two new rules further restricting China’s capability to produce advanced semiconductors. One final rule (the “Entity List Updates Rule”) adds 140 entities to the BIS Entity List and assigns 16 entities the new Footnote 5 designation. Concurrently, an interim final rule makes several changes to the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), including adding new Foreign Direct Product (“FDP”) rules, adding or modifying several Export Control Classification Numbers (“ECCNs”) on the Commerce Control List (“CCL”), adding new license exceptions, and other revisions.

Interested parties may submit public comments to the interim final rule no later than January 31, 2025.

**Entity List Updates**

The Entity List Updates Rule added 140 entities to the BIS Entity List. Most of the newly added entities are Chinese entities, but Japanese, South Korea...

Content: ### PRC semiconductor applications in the military

The BIS cited China's use of advanced semiconductors used in their military as a main reason for the new export bans. Specifically, the United States claims China's access to advanced semiconductors enables their military to produce advanced military systems including weapons of mass destruction, improve the speed and accuracy of military decision-making, planning, and logistics, autonomous systems, and finally to commit human rights abuses.

### Maintaining a global lead in artificial intelligence

Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration Thea D. Rozman Kendler stated "The PRC has poured resources into developing supercomputing capabilities and seeks to become a world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030. It is using these capabilities to monitor, track, and surveil its citizens, and fuel its military modernization."

Content: The **Chinese semiconductor industry**, including integrated circuit design and manufacturing, forms a major part of mainland China's information technology industry.

China's semiconductor industry consists of a wide variety of companies, from integrated device manufacturers to pure-play foundries, fabless semiconductor companies and OSAT companies. Integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) design and manufacture integrated circuits. Pure-play foundries only manufacture devices for other companies, without designing them, while fabless semiconductor companies only design devices. Examples of Chinese IDMs are YMTC and CXMT, examples of Chinese pure-play foundries are SMIC, Hua Hong Semiconductor and Wingtech, examples of Chinese fabless companies are Zhaoxin, HiSilicon, Loongson and UNISOC, and examples of Chinese OSAT companies are JCET, Huatian Technology and Tongfu Microelectronics.

China has responded with an all-out effort to stimulate domestic chip innovation capabilities and eliminate dependency on foreign sources. The outcome of the chip innovation race will determine which country leads in the development and application of AI, with major strategic and economic security implications.\n\nPreventing China from acquiring the most advanced chip technology makes sense from a national security perspective, but export restrictions alone cannot substitute for comprehensive industrial and research policy measures necessary to ensure U.S. leadership in semiconductor design, production, and infrastructure. Moreover, the imposition of export controls has resulted in China doubling down on its existing deeply subsidized development efforts that could well produce breakt...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 2:\nTitle: New Rules Further Restrict China\'s Access to Semiconductor Technology\nURL: https://www.torrestradelaw.com/posts/New-Rules-Further-Restrict-Chinas-Access-to-Semiconductor-Technology\nContent: ## New Rules Further Restrict China’s Access to Semiconductor Technology\n\nOn December 2, 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) issued two new rules further restricting China’s capability to produce advanced semiconductors. One final rule (the “Entity List Updates Rule”) adds 140 entities to the BIS Entity List and assigns 16 entities the new Footnote 5 designation. Concurrently, an interim final rule makes several changes to the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), including adding new Foreign Direct Product (“FDP”) rules, adding or modifying several Export Control Classification Numbers (“ECCNs”) on the Commerce Control List (“CCL”), adding new license exceptions, and other revisions.\n\nInterested parties may submit public comments to the interim final rule no later than January 31, 2025.\n\n**Entity List Updates**\n\nThe Entity List Updates Rule added 140 entities to the BIS Entity List.

Research — AUGUST 13, 2025

Infineon Technologies AG (FWB: IFX) is expected to face another year of sluggish demand before a recovery takes hold in 2026, according to Visible Alpha consensus estimates.

The German semiconductor group’s revenues fell -8% year-on-year in 2024 to €15 billion, weighed down by weakness across most of its end markets, with artificial intelligence one of the few bright spots. A delayed cyclical recovery left the automotive, industrial and connected systems segments struggling to generate momentum.

URL: https://chipdemy.com/infineon-predicts-weak-demand-and-subdued-growth-until-2025/
Content: Germany-based chipmaker Infineon Technologies AG issued a soft outlook for 2025 on weak demand in the major end markets it serves. It is still a leading player in high-growth end markets including automotive, industrial, and consumer electronics. However, it also warned that the company can experience slower growth over the next several years except for demand led by AI advancements.

## Headwinds in End Markets

Infineon‘s Chief Executive Officer Jochen Hanebeck has pointed out the muted circumstances at the company‘s core markets during a recent statement. “If not artificial intelligence, then our end markets offer almost no growth stimulus today, and the cyclical recovery is postponed. We are preparing ourselves, therefore, for a muted business performance in 2025,” Hanebeck said. The caution from the company is a reflection of macroeconomic uncertainties and a difficult global landscape of semiconductors.

Over the last few years, Infineon has also benefited from growing demand for semiconductors in autom...

Content: So thank you, Jerome. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining ST for our Q4 and the full year 2024 earnings conference call. So today, I will start with an overview of the fourth quarter and the full year 2024, including business dynamics. And I will hand over to Lorenzo for the detailed financial overview.

In a persisting challenging environment, we achieved Q4 2024 financial results pretty much in line with the midpoint of our guidance. Our Q4 net revenues decreased 22.4% year over year, and increased 2.2% sequentially to $3.32 billion. Our gross margin was 37.7%, our operating margin was 11.1%, and net income was $341 million. Our Q4 net revenues were in line with the midpoint of our business outlook range, driven by higher revenues in personal electronics, offset by lower revenues in industrial, while automotive and communication equipment and computer peripherals perform as expected. Q4 gross ...

Dear Aldo Kamper, what was decisive for ams OSRAM looking back on the 2024 
­business year?
Aldo Kamper: 2024 was both a difficult and a successful year. We made key ad­vances 
wherever things were in our own hands, and that was despite the weak economic 
trends. We’re proud of that. We consistently pressed ahead with our strategic ‘Re-es-
tablish the Base’ efficiency program, and in part lowered run-rate costs faster than 
initially planned. That impacted very beneficially on profitability and the free cash flow. 
We had to take tough decisions, and, as promised, we shed our less profitable units 
along with those that are no longer part of our core semiconductor business. We suc-
cessfully spun off our passive optical components operations and restructured other 
units. Furthermore, we simply let the remaining legacy business phase out more or less

Title: ams OSRAM - Company Profile and News
URL: https://www.microled-info.com/ams-osram
Content: Austria-based ams OSRAM is a multinational photonics application developer, focusing on sensors, LEDs and light-based treatment solutions.

ams OSRAM is at the forefront of microLED epiwafer production. In 2021, the company announced that it will expand its LED production plant in Kulim, Malaysia, with an investment of around $850 million, with plans to produce mini-LED and micro-LED chips on 8-inch wafers. ams OSRAM hoped to enter microLED mass production in 2024, mainly to supply microLEDs to Apple.

In February 2024, ams-Osram announced that it's cornerstone customer (Apple) cancelled its microLED project, which will have dire implications for Osram's own $850 million 8-inch microLED epiwafer factory in Malaysia - ams-Osram estimated that it will have impairment charges of $650 to $900 million and it will also likely to cancel or delay some of its investments in Malaysia.

ams OSRAM uses Aixtron's systems for LED production.

Content: Nevertheless, I am convinced that Melexis has a promising future. Since our inception we have built a leading position in sense and drive technologies which is expected to support continued growth in the next decade. To capture these opportunities we translate our deep knowledge of the automotive sector into innovations for our customers, while extending our knowledge into new markets beyond automotive. We made progress with our strategy to become even more relevant in China.

We are pleased to showcase our progress according to the requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) for the first time this year. 2024 was also a year in which we implemented our new organizational structure.

Title: Melexis Earnings: 2024 Results Provide a Buying Opportunity for Patient Investors
URL: https://www.morningstar.com/company-reports/1262409-melexis-earnings-2024-results-provide-a-buying-opportunity-for-patient-investors
Content: Melexis' fourth-quarter 2024 revenue was EUR 197.4 million, a 21% organic year-on-year decline and below management’s guided range of EUR 200 million-EUR 210 million. We are not surprised by this result given peers Infineon and ST Microelectronics also had weak automotive sales this quarter as the supply chain reduces excess inventories. Instead of giving full-year guidance, management guided for EUR 400 million in revenue in the first half of the year, followed by a significant improvement in the second half. The extent of this improvement is undetermined and will depend on automotive end-demand and inventory evolution.

Content: Letter to our 
shareholders
Dear Melexis shareholder,
2024 has been an unusual year for Melexis. I commend the many 
achievements our team has made, but I want to start by 
commenting on our primary end market, the automotive industry. 
Although automotive production and sales remain broadly stable, 
this industry is undergoing profound changes: new legislation, 
technology and consumer preferences continue to result in an 
increasing number of electrified vehicles, with fully electric or 
hybrid powertrains, and electronic content growth making cars 
greener, safer and more comfortable. Melexis' global presence and 
diversified customer base is a real strength in the context of major 
shifts in automotive manufacturing and supply chain management. 
Next to the dynamics in the automotive sector, demand for 
semiconductors started to exceed supply in 2020, leading to an 
extended period of chip shortages and triggering investment in 
additional capacity. We finally exited this period of constrained 
supply dur...

Title: Melexis - Part IV
URL: https://dualedgeinvest.substack.com/p/melexis-part-iv
Content: Zooming out, Melexis has been climbing steadily since 2019, except for a quick stumble in 2020, reaching a gross margin of 45.65% by 2023. Revenue? Oh, it’s been growing like a champ—11% annually since 2018, beating many competitors. For example, Qualcomm saw a 12% revenue dip from FY 2022 to FY 2024, and MTG dropped 7% from FY 2023 to FY 2024 (though they had a wild 32% boost the year before).

Bottom line? Melexis is steadily growing revenue and bouncing back on margins, proving they’ve got the stamina to stay in the game—and that’s no small feat in the ever-shifting world of semiconductors! For the visual people, a graphical representation:

**Innovation at Melexis**

Now let’s dive into another key strength of Melexis: innovation. It’s their secret sauce for staying ahead of the competition and a major selling point for investors. They achieve this by (1) focusing on cutting-edge chip design and (2) recruiting top-notch talent.

The first point is a perfect fit for their fabless business model, letting th...

Revenue grew by 12% year over year and management guided for 3% to 4% growth in revenue during fiscal 2024. In line with other peers, Melexis expects a weaker first half of the year followed by a stronger second half, according to its conversations with customers. Inventory at distributors keeps decreasing, but at some point during the year they should start being replenished. Growth in 2024 should mainly come from volumes as management expects pricing to remain relatively constant. We maintain our EUR 100 fair value estimate with shares offering 20% upside.

Revenue? Oh, it’s been growing like a champ—11% annually since 2018, beating many competitors. For example, Qualcomm saw a 12% revenue dip from FY 2022 to FY 2024, and MTG dropped 7% from FY 2023 to FY 2024 (though they had a wild 32% boost the year before).\n\nBottom line? Melexis is steadily growing revenue and bouncing back on margins, proving they’ve got the stamina to stay in the game—and that’s no small feat in the ever-shifting world of semiconductors! For the visual people, a graphical representation:\n\n**Innovation at Melexis**\n\nNow let’s dive into another key strength of Melexis: innovation.

Content: Letter to our 
shareholders
Dear Melexis shareholder,
2024 has been an unusual year for Melexis. I commend the many 
achievements our team has made, but I want to start by 
commenting on our primary end market, the automotive industry. 
Although automotive production and sales remain broadly stable, 
this industry is undergoing profound changes: new legislation, 
technology and consumer preferences continue to result in an 
increasing number of electrified vehicles, with fully electric or 
hybrid powertrains, and electronic content growth making cars 
greener, safer and more comfortable. Melexis' global presence and 
diversified customer base is a real strength in the context of major 
shifts in automotive manufacturing and supply chain management. 
Next to the dynamics in the automotive sector, demand for 
semiconductors started to exceed supply in 2020, leading to an 
extended period of chip shortages and triggering investment in 
additional capacity. We finally exited this period of constrained 
supply dur...

Content: While European carmakers are adapting to the electrification trend, Asia is emerging as a dominant force, with high production and sales volumes, fueled by a growing middle class. Adapting to the expectations of Asian customers, who prioritize speed, cost efficient solutions and specific product requirements, is crucial. In order to do this, we are already actively building strong connections in Asia. The inauguration of our new facility in Malaysia in the summer of 2024 will give us extra impact in the entire region. I would like to commend our colleagues in Kyiv for their outstanding work in very difficult conditions. They delivered a major project for a key customer with excellence. In 2024, they are working on another very important project for another key customer with impressive commitment. We are immensely proud of our people in Ukraine for their resilience and motivation.

URL: https://www.morningstar.com/company-reports/1262409-melexis-earnings-2024-results-provide-a-buying-opportunity-for-patient-investors
Content: Melexis' fourth-quarter 2024 revenue was EUR 197.4 million, a 21% organic year-on-year decline and below management’s guided range of EUR 200 million-EUR 210 million. We are not surprised by this result given peers Infineon and ST Microelectronics also had weak automotive sales this quarter as the supply chain reduces excess inventories. Instead of giving full-year guidance, management guided for EUR 400 million in revenue in the first half of the year, followed by a significant improvement in the second half. The extent of this improvement is undetermined and will depend on automotive end-demand and inventory evolution.

Content: Despite this, our ‘24 sales were broadly stable and significantly better than most of our peers. Of course, there are many highlights in ‘24.

We had a record number of product launches, which is the starting point for future sales growth. The success of Melexis has always been built on enabling our customer to gain market share based on our innovations.

I’m happy to see that we continue to capture a strong level of design wins in automotive and beyond automotive applications. In automotive, design wins covered a wide range of electrification, comfort and safety applications.

In powertrain, the design wins are well balanced across EV, hybrid and ICE, enabling us to capture growth irrespective of the type of engine. Geographically, we had a strong design win performance in China, confirming that we are taking the right steps to ensure our position in this important market.

Looking ahead, in the short term, some customer inventory correction are continuing in the first half of ‘25. We continue to work very c...

Content: 2024. I encourage you to learn more about this in our Sustainability 
report. 
Turning to people and culture, we implemented a new 
organizational structure to support more autonomy, faster decision 
making and an entrepreneurial mindset. Linked to this, many of our 
team leads completed the first modules of our new leadership 
training to drive the cultural transformation. We are also maturing 
in our talent management approach to ensure we have the critical 
capabilities and skills to support our growth ambitions.
Financial performance
Our 2024 sales were EUR 932.8 million, a decrease of 3% compared 
to the previous year due to fourth quarter sales which were 
impacted by the inventory correction at customers. Magnetic 
position sensors as well as motor drivers outperformed overall 
sales in 2024. The gross profit margin was 43% and operating 
margin was 23.6%. 
The Board of Directors approved to propose to the annual 
shareholders’ meeting a total dividend of EUR 3.70 gross per share

Title: Melexis NV (MELE.BR) - Revenue - Companies Market Cap
URL: https://companiesmarketcap.com/melexis/revenue/
Content: According to Melexis NV's latest financial reports the company's current revenue (TTM ) is $0.94 Billion USD. In 2024 the company made a revenue of $1.00 Billion USD a decrease over the revenue in the year 2023 that were of $1.04 Billion USD. The revenue is the total amount of income that a company generates by the sale of goods or services. Unlike with the earnings no expenses are subtracted.

Rotterdam School of Management / Erasmus University... Highlights 
Our fundamental analysis and valuation indicate a SELL:  
We issue a sell recommendation with a target price of 18.30 EUR. Despite 
having a good underlying business model, we believe Melexis stock is 
overvalued at the current level of 23.52 EUR. Our DCF model points to an 
intrinsic value forecast of 18.30 EUR per share representing a 22% downside 
from the current share price. In addition, we validated our sell 
recommendation with several other valuation methods (trading and 
transaction multiples, sum of the parts valuation (Appendix C.XV) and a Monte 
Carlo free cash flow model). 
Main price drivers for our cautious outlook for Melexis: 
� 
Margin pressure for Melexis’ automotive business segment: 
Pressure on margins increases as several industry heavyweights are 
planning to enter the automotive semiconductor industry, increasing 
competition. Additionally, rising salary costs negatively impact margi...

Our DCF model points to an \nintrinsic value forecast of 18.30 EUR per share representing a 22% downside \nfrom the current share price. In addition, we validated our sell \nrecommendation with several other valuation methods (trading and \ntransaction multiples, sum of the parts valuation (Appendix C.XV) and a Monte \nCarlo free cash flow model). \nMain price drivers for our cautious outlook for Melexis: \n� \nMargin pressure for Melexis’ automotive business segment: \nPressure on margins increases as several industry heavyweights are \nplanning to enter the automotive semiconductor industry, increasing \ncompetition. Additionally, rising salary costs negatively impact margi...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'}

Shareholders might have noticed that

**X-FAB Silicon Foundries SE** (EPA:XFAB) filed its half-yearly result this time last week. The early response was not positive, with shares down 5.1% to €5.92 in the past week. It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$421m were what the analysts expected, X-FAB Silicon Foundries surprised by delivering a (statutory) profit of US$0.15 per share, an impressive 36% above what was forecast. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.
