## European industries depend on semiconductors

Europe is a notable market within the global semiconductor industry, leading in research and development, advanced materials, and manufacturing equipment. Demand for semiconductors in Europe stems particularly from its high-growth sectors, such as across the automotive and industrial markets.

## The European Chips Act to boost Europe’s position

Diversification is a key strategic aim for the semiconductor industry in Europe, not just at the fabrication stage, but all parts of the supply chain. To support this, the European Union has mobilized 43 billion euros of public and private investment as ...

Title: 2025 global semiconductor industry outlook - Deloitte
URL: https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-telecom-outlooks/semiconductor-industry-outlook.html
Content: The semiconductor industry had a robust 2024, with expected double-digit (19%) growth, and sales of US$627 billion for the year.

1 But that’s even better than the earlier forecast of US$611 billion. 2 And 2025 could be even better, with predicted sales of US$697 billion, 3 reaching a new all-time high, and well on track to reach the widely accepted aspirational goal of US$1 trillion in chip sales by 2030. This suggests the industry only needs to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.5% between 2025 and 2030 (figure 1). 4 Assuming the industry continues to grow at that rate, it could reach US$2 trillion in 2040.

The stock market is often a leading indicator of industry performance: As of mid-December 2024, the combined market capitalization of the top 10 global chip companies was US$6.5 trillion—up 93% from US$3.4 trillion in mid-December 2023 and 235% higher than the US$1.9 trillion seen in mid-November 2022.

Despite macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, ASML has again delivered strong performance in 2023. We have grown sales by 30% to €27.6 billion and lifted our gross margin to 51.3%. We returned €3.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. At the end of 2023, we finished with a backlog of €39.0 billion and we anticipate that with our sustained focus on technology innovation, we will continue to break new ground – not only in terms of technological development, but also in how we manage the environmental impact of our products and services.

Content: ### DUV lithography

Deep ultraviolet lithography (DUV) devices from ASML use light that penetrates the UV spectrum to print the tiny features that form the microchip's structure.

### EUV lithography

Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) is a critical technology used to create the smallest and most complex chip designs. ASML holds a near-monopoly in the EUV market. The company's machines are capable of etching patterns as small as 8 nanometers, 1/10000 the width of a human hair.

EUV machines produce light in the 13.5 nm wavelength range by focusing a high-energy laser on microscopic droplets of molten tin to produce a plasma, which then emits EUV light. The light is bounced off Zeiss mirrors onto the surface of a silicon wafer to form the designs for the chip.

In 2009, the IMEC research center in Belgium produced the world's first functional 22 nm CMOS Static random-access memory memory cells with a prototype EUV lithography machine. After decades of development, ASML shipped the first production EUV mach...

### Robust results in a challenging macro environment

In conversation with our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Roger Dassen

In 2023, we delivered on our expectations in spite of the challenges. We reported an excellent financial performance, with sales up by 30% and a gross margin of 51.3%. When taking the macro environment into account – inflation, high interest rates, falling GDPs, geopolitical tensions and a downturn in the semiconductor industry – this achievement was little short of remarkable.

Firstly, we had been significantly supply-constrained in both 2021 and 2022, and over the last 12 months we saw those constraints ease. The supply bottlenecks created by COVID-19 restrictions have now worked their way through the system. This meant that over 2021 and 2022, we built up a very significant backlog that we could start eating into in 2023.

URL: https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/manufacturing/asml-triples-order-bookings-in-q4-2023-thanks-to-demand-for-euv-tools
Content: As chipmakers are gearing up for inevitable increase of demand for logic and memory chips in 2024 and 2025, they're procuring more wafer fab equipment to increase their capacity. As a result, ASML's Q4 2023 revenue jumped to $7.237 billion — a 12.5% increase year-over-year — while its order intake reached a record €9.186 billion ($10.036 billion) — more than tripling YoY — as makers of memory and logic ordered additional extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tools.

"After a few soft quarters, the order intake for the quarter was very, very strong," said Roger Dassen, chief financial officer of ASML. "Actually, a record order intake at €9.2 billion. If you look at the composition of that, it was about 50/50 for Memory versus Logic. Around €5.6 billion out of the €9.2 was related to EUV, both Low-NA and High-NA."

ASML's revenue for last year totaled €27.6 billion, its total net income hit €7.8 billion, and its gross margin reached 51.3%. The company recognized revenue for 53 EUV lithography tools, 125 immersi...

URL: https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/asml-records-highest-ever-revenue-in-2023-high-na-euv-to-drive-long-term-growth/
Content: Record sales in Q4 2023 drove ASML’s 2023 revenue to an all-time high of €27.6 billion, despite the semiconductor industry going through a cyclical downturn during the year. The growth was further supported by the higher revenue from service and upgrades, with logic growing 60% YoY and memory growing 9% YoY.

**Increased confidence in high-NA tools being the most cost-effective solution **

Commenting on the most sophisticated high-NA tool, ASML CEO Peter Wennink said, “Confidence in high-NA tools being the most cost-effective solution, both in memory and logic, has increased over the years. Our customers are convinced that high-NA is a more cost-effective solution as compared to multiple patterning using low-NA tools, evident with the order intake received.”

**Analysis: **... High-NA tools are expected to be launched in 2024 but the industry is still in the initial phase of establishing a high-NA-enabling ecosystem. Chipmakers will have to order these tools now as these tools have a longer lead time and wil...

URL: https://tamalroy.substack.com/p/arm-holdings-q4-2023-ai-tailwinds
Content: ### The stock jumped 50%

In an impressive display of financial performance, Arm Holdings has announced its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023, causing its stock to surge by 50% due to optimistic guidance for 2024 and business outlook in AI tailwinds. This surge underscores the market’s confidence in Arm’s business model and its pivotal role in the semiconductor industry.

**Arm’s Business Model: A Blueprint for Success**

At the heart of Arm Holdings’ success is a unique business model that eschews traditional semiconductor manufacturing in favor of designing semiconductor architectures. These designs are then licensed to tech giants like Apple, which, in turn, engage manufacturers such as TSMC to bring them to life in their devices. This model allows Arm to earn substantial licensing fees and royalties, positioning it as a linchpin in the tech ecosystem.

Arm’s designs, based on its proprietary architecture, compete directly with the x86 architecture used by Intel. However, Arm has successfully carved ...

Content: # Arm Holdings: Assessing the AI-Driven Growth Story vs. Overvalued RealitiesWritten byEli Grant

- Arm Holdings leverages AI-driven growth through energy-efficient chip licensing, with 43.7% of 2025 revenue from AI-related deals.

- Strategic partnerships with AWS, Google, and Microsoft accelerate data center adoption, targeting 50% CPU market share by 2025.

- Sky-high valuation (P/E 200.14) raises risks from regulatory scrutiny, RISC-V competition, and China's geopolitical uncertainties.

- Long-term AI infrastructure potential exists, but investors must balance Arm's IP dominance against supply constraints and margin pressures.

In the high-stakes arena of tech investing, few stories have captured the imagination—and wallets—of investors quite likeArm Holdings. The company, long a quiet titan in semiconductor IP licensing, has surged into the spotlight as a key player in the AI revolution. But as its valuation balloons to stratospheric levels, a critical question emerges: Is Arm's dominance in AI-driven c...

Content: and a smart and secure IoT. Five core applications are particularly strong drivers for our business: electromobility, renewable energy, automated driving, data centers – propelled by the ever-increasing use of artificial intelligence – and IoT. These applications will account for around 60 percent of our expected revenue growth over the coming years. So that Infineon can make the most of these major growth opportunities, we are setting the course and laying the groundwork early on. Investments in manufacturing capacities and security of supply will set Infineon up for long-term growth Our manufacturing strategy is based on clear principles.

Content: 1. Message from the President and Chief Executive Officer on the financial year 2023

Dear Shareholder,

2023 was another year of growth, driven by strong demand in Automotive and, to a lesser extent, Industrial, partially offset by lower revenues in Personal Electronics. This was reflected in our financial performance, with net revenues increasing 7.2% to $17.29 billion. We continued to strengthen our net financial position while increasing free cash flow and investing in the transformation of our manufacturing base. In this respect, 2023 was another year of steady execution in our manufacturing initiatives as we continued to transform our manufacturing base to enable future growth and drive enhanced profitability, with the expansion of our 300mm capacity and a strong focus on wide bandgap semiconductors.

Content: Third, for many years, we have been providing high performance ladle diodes for material treatment industrial applications. Applications range from bottling equipment to copper welding in the production of EVs.

2023 was a good year in terms of winning new business in this profitable niche. Likewise, laser projection in industrial application and other interesting application in 2023, we could win significant business in this market as well.

Finally, our time-of-flight sensors are key element of many home consumer or portable consumer devices. 2023 was a good design win year for those as well.

With these examples, I want to give you an impression that we're also constantly winning new business beyond automotive although the individual project is typically much smaller due to the market structure. Nevertheless, it adds up, the three examples from industrial and consumer that I just mentioned are representing a combined design win number in the order of EUR150 million.

URL: https://siliconmatter.substack.com/p/x-fab-an-overlooked-company
Content: ### X-FAB is a semiconductor foundry focused on automotive, industrial, and medical sectors. Despite market doubts, its investments in capacity expansion positions it for potential long-term growth.

X-FAB ($XFAB) is an interesting, but relatively small, semiconductor foundry headquartered in Europe. As illustrated in Figure 1 below, X-FAB not only operates in Europe, but also has facilities in the United States and Malaysia. The company’s current market cap is $800 million at a stock price of €5.40 – which emphasizes its relatively small size.

For those unfamiliar with what a foundry business is, it can be described as a contract manufacturing business for semiconductors. What X-FAB does, is take a bare silicon wafer and process it through 500-1,000 manufacturing steps based on customer specifications and blueprints. The typical production process at X-FAB involves 10-55 masks (stencils), and it takes 30-120 days to complete each wafer.
