Title: SK hynix hits record profit powered by AI memory demand
URL: https://blocksandfiles.com/2025/01/23/sk-hynix-q4-2024/
Content: High-bandwidth memory demand, fueled by AI-focused GPU servers, has propelled SK hynix revenues and net income to record highs for the fourth 2024 quarter and full year.

The company reported ₩19.76 trillion ($13.76 billion) in preliminary revenues for the quarter, 74.7 percent higher year-on-year, with a net profit of ₩8 trillion ($5.56 billion), markedly contrasting with the year-ago ₩1.38 trillion ($960 million) loss. The full 2024 year numbers were remarkable too, with revenues of ₩66.19 trillion ($45.97 billion), up 49.5 percent, and a vast turnaround from the year-ago ₩9.14 trillion ($6.36 billion) loss to a ₩19.8 trillion ($13.8 billion) net profit. The company’s financial situation has been transformed.

VP and CFO Kim Woohyun stated: “With significantly increased portion of high value-added products, SK hynix has built fundamental to achieve sustainable revenues and profits even in times of market correction.”

Title: SK hynix talks up AI demand as memory market recovers
URL: https://blocksandfiles.com/2023/10/26/sk-hynix-q3-2023/
Content: SK hynix revenues for the third 2023 quarter ended September 30 were $6.9 billion, down 16.4 percent annually, with a net loss of $1.66 billion as the memory market recovers from recession. The results were helped by demand for its HBM3 memory used by Nvidia GPUs.

**Update**: added note about SK hynix opposing terms of Kioxia Western Digital merger deal; added note about merger talks ending. 26 October.

The drop represents an improvement on the dive in Q2, which was a whopping 47 percent, and a narrowing of losses, which stood at $2.14 billion in Q2.

The Korean company fabricates DRAM and NAND chips, and builds SSDs. This was its second successive growth quarter, with both DRAM and NAND contributing, as well as average selling price increases. The DRAM business has turned around after two quarters of losses. SK hynix said: “Revenues grew 24 percent, while operating losses narrowed 38 percent, compared with the previous quarter, thanks to strong demand for high-performance mobile flagship products and HBM3,...

Content: Most fabless semiconductor companies such as AMD, Apple, ARM, Broadcom, Marvell, MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Nvidia are customers of TSMC, as are emerging companies such as Allwinner Technology, HiSilicon, Spectra7, and UNISOC. Programmable logic device companies Xilinx and previously Altera also make or made use of TSMC's foundry services. Some integrated device manufacturers that have their own fabrication facilities, such as Intel, NXP, STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments, outsource some of their production to TSMC.

TSMC has a global capacity of about thirteen million 300 mm-equivalent wafers per year as of 2020 and produces chips for customers with process nodes from 2 microns to 3 nanometres. TSMC was the first foundry to market 7-nanometre and 5-nanometre (used by the 2020 Apple A14 and M1 SoCs, the MediaTek Dimensity 8100, and AMD Ryzen 7000 series processors) production capabilities, and the first to commercialize ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology in high volume.... ### Busine...

Content: Ever since the rise of ChatGPT and competitors from big tech companies like Meta, Alphabet or X, generative AI has become the newest golden goose of the industry. Some experts claim this specific AI trend bubble is bound to burst soon or that it is “useless”, as one market analyst said in a recent interview with Fortune. As of now, the financial results of companies like Nvidia, which has strengthened its focus on its data center segment in the past two years, tell a different story. The same goes for Nvidia’s chief business partner, the semiconductor manufacturer TSMC.

The Taiwanese company offers foundry services, meaning they build chips for companies that are unable or unwilling to do so themselves. This business was lucrative before the pandemic, but was accelerated in the post-pandemic AI push. As TSMC annual reports and data from CompaniesMarketCap.com show, TSMC had a market cap of $287 billion at the end of 2019 and generated $11.5 billion of annual income from revenues of $35.7 billion in the same ...

(I) Operations: 
Nanya Technology Corporation’s (“Nanya”) consolidated revenue amounted 
to NT$29.89 billion in 2023, down 47.5% compared with NT$56.95 billion in 
2022. The after-tax loss was NT$7.44 billion, representing a net profit margin of -
24.9%, or loss per share at NT$2.40. 
In 2023, for end-use information products such as servers, data centers, 
mobile phones, laptops, and more, the momentum of end-demand was weak and 
inventory adjustment was slow. According to estimates from research institutes, 
global dynamic memory (DRAM) revenues decreased by approximately 38% 
compared with that in the previous year, and the average selling price fell by more 
than 40%.  
DRAM manufacturers successively extended production cuts in the first half 
of 2023 to improve supply-demand imbalances. In the second half of 2023, the 
demand for related products such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DDR5 
grew thanks to the popularity of generative artificial int...

Lenovo delivers stable profitability in year of accelerating transformation 
 
May 24, 2023– Lenovo Group (HKSE: 992) (ADR: LNVGY) today announced full-year results, reporting 
Group revenue of US$62 billion and net income of US$1.6 billion, or US$1.9 billion on a non-Hong Kong

## Try till you make it

Like so many of today’s electronics and technology companies in China, Lenovo was founded after the PRC introduced market reforms in the 1980s. At first, the enterprise tried its hands at importing television imports but had no success. Afterward, Lenovo began quality checks on computers and selling digital watches which also failed. Only after the company relocated to Hong Kong and began producing and selling computers under today’s brand name, the business venture turned profitable. Today, Lenovo is one of the leading PC vendors worldwide with over 14 million shipments per quarter.

By 2018, Huawei had sold 200 million smartphones. In 2019, Huawei reported revenue of US$122 billion. By the second quarter of 2020, Huawei had become the world's top smartphone seller, overtaking Samsung for the first time. In 2021, Huawei was ranked the second-largest R&D investor in the world by the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC) in its EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard and ranked fifth in the world in US patents according to a report by Fairview Research's IFI Claims Patent Services.

By the end of third quarter in 2022, Huawei revenue had dropped a further 19.7% since the beginning of the year. Yet, for the eight consecutive year, Huawei remained the top patent applicant for patent...

Content: Huawei Technologies reported a rebound in sales growth for 2023, driven by its comeback in the high-end 5G smartphone segment with the popular Mate 60 series, as the sanctions-hit company faces further US scrutiny for the chip breakthrough that powered its resurgence. The privately held firm recorded a 9.63 per cent increase in revenue to 704.2 billion yuan (US$97 billion) in 2023, Huawei said in its annual report released on Friday. Net profit for the year was 87 billion yuan, up 144.5 per cent year on year, partly thanks to recurring gains from its sale of budget smartphone unit Honor and other assets. Profit margin was 12.35 per cent in 2023, compared to a historical low of 5.5 per cent in 2022. Sales from Huawei's consumer business, which includes its popular flagship 5G smartphones and its co-developed Aito electric cars,... recorded a 17.3 per cent increase to 251.5 billion yuan in 2023, being one of the strongest segments. US said to weigh sanctions against Huawei's secretive chip supply network It was...

By 2018, Huawei had sold 200 million smartphones. In 2019, Huawei reported revenue of US$122 billion. By the second quarter of 2020, Huawei had become the world's top smartphone seller, overtaking Samsung for the first time. In 2021, Huawei was ranked the second-largest R&D investor in the world by the EU Joint Research Centre (JRC) in its EU Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard and ranked fifth in the world in US patents according to a report by Fairview Research's IFI Claims Patent Services.

However, heavy international sanctions saw Huawei's revenues drop by 32% in the third quarter of 2021. Linghao Bao, an analyst at policy research firm Trivium China said the "communications giant went from being the second-largest smartphone maker in the world, after Samsung, to essentially dead." By the end of third quarter in 2022, Huawei revenue had dropped a further 19.7% since the beginning of the year. Yet, for the eight consecutive year, Huawei remained the top patent applicant for patent...

Content: AsianFin -- Huawei Technologies Ltd posted robust growth of both the top and bottom line in 2023, a year the Chinese tech giant waged its long-anticipated counterattack.

Huawei said at its annual report that revenue for 2023 rose year-over-year (YoY) 9.64%to RMB704.2 billion (US$99.18 billion). The yearly sales were still 21% below Huawei’s 2020 peak of RMB891 billion, but delivered the highest growth rate since the Trump administration blacklisted the company in 2019, compared with a merely 0.9% YoY growth during 2022. Huawei’s revenue in the fourth quarter surged 26% YoY to RMB 247.6 billion based on its annual figure. That suggested a significant acceleration from the previous quarter. The company said last October revenue rose 2.4% YoY to RMB456.6 billion in the first three quarters of 2023, representing a 1.5% YoY increase in the third quarter alone.

The annual report also showed net income soared more than 144% YoY to RMB87.0 billion. That is the largest rise in profit for Huawei since it started repo...

Title: Quanta profits double despite halving workforce
URL: https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240617PD205/quanta-ai-server-automotive-profit-revenue-workforce.html
Content: Quanta Computer is generating record-high profits amid a sharp decline in staff count. From the high of 112,000 employees by the end of 2018, Quanta's workforce has decreased by 49.1% to around 57,000 by the end of 2023.

The AI boom is shifting the revenue structure of original design manufacturers (ODMs) to the production of servers and automotive products, which involve more automation in production than the previous focus on notebook (NB) and Apple Watch manufacturing. These changes effectively reduce product line staff and boost profits.

The stronger growth in server and automotive products is slowly changing the composition of the ODM revenue structure.

Winstron's PC-related sales (NB, desktops, and monitors) accounted for 80% of all revenue in 2023 but are expected to drop toward 75% in the next year. Non-PC-related sales profits already account for 65% of profit share, and will most likely increase with further AI server development.

Content: # Quanta Computer Exceeds AI Server Revenue Expectations with Strong Growth

Quanta Computer, a leading OEM manufacturer, announced impressive growth in its AI server segment during a press conference held on August 9th. Chief Financial Officer Elton Yang revealed that AI servers have exceeded expectations, achieving more than 50% of overall server revenue ahead of schedule. In the third quarter, non-PC revenue is expected to surpass 70%, with AI server revenue predicted to grow by a triple-digit percentage this year.

Yang noted that improved GPU supply in the second quarter bolstered AI server momentum, leading to higher-than-expected revenue contributions. This trend is expected to continue, with AI servers outperforming general-purpose servers in terms of growth. Major cloud service providers are increasing their investments in AI, enhancing project visibility and driving demand.

Despite market rumors about the postponement of Blackwell product shipments, Yang emphasized that customer demand remains stro...

Event 
Quanta announced 1Q24 EPS of NT$3.13 (up 17% QoQ and 86% YoY), beating consensus 
and our projection. The firm guides growing NB shipments and server sales growth QoQ 
in 2Q24F, and for 2H24F expects strong server sales growth, with AI contribution up to 
over 50% of server sales, with further increases in 2025F. 
Impact 
1Q24 EPS beat on margins & non-op. 1Q24 EPS of NT$3.13 beat consensus and our 
estimate on stronger-than-expected gross margin of 8.5% (up 0.4ppts QoQ) and operating 
margin of 4.5% (up 0.4ppts QoQ), and better non-operating income. Solid gross and 
operating margins were due to better product mix with increased low-ASP NB shipments 
weighting, favorable forex trends and stable operating expenses. NB sales contribution 
was down to 35% in 1Q24, vs. 43% in 1Q23 and 39-40% in 4Q23, while server and auto... sales weightings rose, boosting gross margin. Coupled with net int...

Gross profit margin, operating profit margin and net profit margin were 6.33%, 3.16% and 2.47%, respectively, compared with 6.42%, 2.88% and 2.26% in the same period last year. EPS reached NT$3.19 in the April-June quarter, up by NT$0.66 from NT$2.53 a year earlier.

The increase in gross profit reflects the growth in AI server shipments and improved operational efficiency, which further boosted overall profitability and brought the operating profit margin performance in line wi...

In 2022, Accton partnered with TSMC, Delta Electronics, Gigabyte Technology, MIRLE, and 3M to develop newer data center immersion cooling offerings that reduce energy consumption. That year Accton began shipping 400G switches at scale. The transition from 100G to 400G switches was driven by the increasing demands of 5G, Wi-Fi 6, IoT, AI, and digital transformations in consumer electronics and enterprise sectors. This escalation in demand is particularly notable among major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. Also in 2022, Accton developed Vodafone's disaggregated cell site gateway (DCSG) routers for their 5G network. These routers are critical to Vodafone's strategy to automate networks and diversify vendors, supporting the company's expansion of its 5G infrastructure as part of its open RAN initiatives.

Title: Operating Margin for Accton Technology (2345.TW)
URL: https://companiesmarketcap.com/accton-technology/operating-margin/
Content: According to Accton Technology's latest financial reports and stock price the company's current Operating Margin is 12.87%. At the end of 2024 the company had an Operating Margin of 13.71%.

The operating margin is a key indicator to assess the profitability of a company. Higher operating margins are generaly better as they show that a company is able to sell its products or services for much more than their production costs. The operating margin is calculated by dividing a company's earnings by its revenue.

The market capitalization sometimes referred as Marketcap, is the value of a publicly listed company.

In most cases it can be easily calculated by multiplying the share price with the amount of outstanding shares.

CompaniesMarketCap is not associated in any way with CoinMarketCap.com

Stock prices are delayed, the delay can range from a few minutes to several hours.

Title: Accton
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accton_Technology_Corporation
Content: ## Services

In 2022, Accton partnered with TSMC, Delta Electronics, Gigabyte Technology, MIRLE, and 3M to develop newer data center immersion cooling offerings that reduce energy consumption. That year Accton began shipping 400G switches at scale. The transition from 100G to 400G switches was driven by the increasing demands of 5G, Wi-Fi 6, IoT, AI, and digital transformations in consumer electronics and enterprise sectors. This escalation in demand is particularly notable among major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. Also in 2022, Accton developed Vodafone's disaggregated cell site gateway (DCSG) routers for their 5G network. These routers are critical to Vodafone's strategy to automate networks and diversify vendors, supporting the company's expansion of its 5G infrastructure as part of its open RAN initiatives.

Since 2021, Accton has been involved in developing and producing multiple generations of Intel's Habana Labs GOYA AI Inference Card, GAUDI AI Training Card, and GAUDI HLS-1 AI T...

Content: ### Gross margin performance

In 2024, TSMC’s gross margin increased to 56.1% of net revenue from 54.4% in 2023, mainly attributable to higher capacity utilization and productivity gains, and partially offset by 3-nanometer ramp-up and higher electricity cost.

Gross margin fluctuates with the level of capacity utilization, price change, cost improvement, product mix, and exchange rate, among other factors. TSMC achieved 56.1% in 2024, although partly offset by 3nm ramp-up and higher electricity costs.

Research and development expenses increased by NT$21,812 million in 2024, or 12.0%, from 2023. The increases were mainly attributed to a higher level of research activities for 14-angstrom, 16-angstrom, and 2-nanometer process technologies, as TSMC continued to advance to smaller processing nodes.

TSMC’s research and development activities are divided into centralized and fab-conducted research and development activities. Centralized research and development activities focus on developing new logic, SoC, deri...

TSMC achieved 56.1% in 2024, although partly offset by 3nm ramp-up and higher electricity costs.\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by NT$21,812 million in 2024, or 12.0%, from 2023. The increases were mainly attributed to a higher level of research activities for 14-angstrom, 16-angstrom, and 2-nanometer process technologies, as TSMC continued to advance to smaller processing nodes.\n\nTSMC’s research and development activities are divided into centralized and fab-conducted research and development activities.

Content: In the fiscal year 2023/24, Lenovo generated a revenue of over 57 billion U.S. dollars. The intelligent device segment accounted for the company's largest share in revenue, generating 73 percent of the total.

## Try till you make it

Like so many of today’s electronics and technology companies in China, Lenovo was founded after the PRC introduced market reforms in the 1980s. At first, the enterprise tried its hands at importing television imports but had no success. Afterward, Lenovo began quality checks on computers and selling digital watches which also failed. Only after the company relocated to Hong Kong and began producing and selling computers under today’s brand name, the business venture turned profitable. Today, Lenovo is one of the leading PC vendors worldwide with over 14 million shipments per quarter.

Content: ## Understanding AI Export Rules

### What are AI Export Controls?

AI export controls are rules that restrict the transfer of artificial intelligence technologies, software, and related data across international borders. These controls aim to prevent the misuse of AI for purposes that could threaten national security, human rights, or enable the development of weapons of mass destruction.

### Regulatory Bodies and Global Frameworks

Several organizations play a key role in establishing and enforcing AI export control rules:

|Organization|Role|
|--|--|
|United States Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)|Oversees the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which cover the export of dual-use technologies, including certain AI software and hardware.|
|European Union|Implemented export control regulations through the Dual-Use Regulation, covering the export of dual-use items, including some AI technologies.|
|Wassenaar Arrangement|A multilateral export control regime that promotes transparency and responsibil...

Content: According to industry analysts, the global Internet of Things (IoT) market size is projected to grow from $714.48 billion in 2024 to $4,062.34 billion by 2032. With a CAGR of 24.3%, this market growth is driven by advancements in technology that continue to enhance miniaturization, low power consumption, and performance. As devices shrink in size, they incorporate more features and functionalities than ever before, enabling new applications that were previously impractical.

One of the key drivers behind this trend is NOR Flash memory, which powers these devices. This is particularly evident in industrial factory automation and smart home control applications, where integration, energy efficiency, and performance are crucial. These markets also demand resilience to high temperatures. In industrial environments, smart devices often operate in locations with significant heat generation, such as factory floors, oil refineries, or automobiles, necessitating effective performance under harsh conditions.

URL: https://www.csis.org/analysis/limits-chip-export-controls-meeting-china-challenge
Content: The U.S. government and those of its allies have imposed and progressively tightened controls on the export of semiconductor technology, devices, and tools to China in an effort to maintain U.S. leadership in this critical sector. China has responded with an all-out effort to stimulate domestic chip innovation capabilities and eliminate dependency on foreign sources. The outcome of the chip innovation race will determine which country leads in the development and application of AI, with major strategic and economic security implications.

Preventing China from acquiring the most advanced chip technology makes sense from a national security perspective, but export restrictions alone cannot substitute for comprehensive industrial and research policy measures necessary to ensure U.S. leadership in semiconductor design, production, and infrastructure. Moreover, the imposition of export controls has resulted in China doubling down on its existing deeply subsidized development efforts that could well produce breakt...

An initial assessment of recent attempts by the United States to limit or delay China’s ability to acquire and produce advanced semiconductor technologies reveals a mixed picture in a complex and rapidly evolving industry. On the one hand, new chip restrictions have significantly affected China’s semiconductor ecosystem, limiting access to equipment essential for next-generation production. On the other hand, China is intensifying its domestic investments in more advanced chips while also reducing market shares of U.S. firms—and by extension, the revenues U.S. firms need to invest in the next-generation of technology. Over time, this loss of market share could well undermine the competitiveness of U.S. firms in this key industry. The initial volley of restrictions has also revealed limitations of export controls, both because the technology is rapidly changing and because there are gaps in compliance between U.S. companies and those of allies.

Title: The Semiconductor Scaling And The Growing Energy Demand
URL: https://www.chetanpatil.in/the-semiconductor-scaling-and-the-growing-energy-demand/
Content: # The Semiconductor Scaling And The Growing Energy Demand

*Image Generated Using DALL·E*

The rapid progress of semiconductor technology is built on a simple principle: by scaling transistors down, more components can be packed into a chip, resulting in higher performance.

Over the past half‑century, this strategy has delivered exponential growth in computing power, but it has also unleashed a hidden cost.

As manufacturing processes have become more complex and factories have grown larger, the energy required to produce each wafer and to operate cutting-edge tools has risen significantly.

Let us examine how the pursuit of smaller features and increased functionality influences the energy footprint of semiconductor manufacturing.

**Scaling’s Hidden Energy Burden**

The paradox of semiconductor scaling is that even as transistors have become more energy-efficient, the total energy required to manufacture chips has continued to rise. In the early 1980s, a survey by SEMATECH and the U.S. Department of Commer...

## Try till you make it

Like so many of today’s electronics and technology companies in China, Lenovo was founded after the PRC introduced market reforms in the 1980s. At first, the enterprise tried its hands at importing television imports but had no success. Afterward, Lenovo began quality checks on computers and selling digital watches which also failed. Only after the company relocated to Hong Kong and began producing and selling computers under today’s brand name, the business venture turned profitable. Today, Lenovo is one of the leading PC vendors worldwide with over 14 million shipments per quarter.

Title: Lenovo

Content: In early June 2015, Lenovo announced plans to sell up to US$650 million in five-year bonds denominated in Chinese yuan. The bonds were sold in Hong Kong with coupon ranging from 4.95% to 5.05%. This is only the second sale of bonds in Lenovo's history. Financial commentators noted that Lenovo was paying a premium to list the bonds in yuan given relatively low costs for borrowing in US dollars.

Lenovo said that its x86 servers will be available to all its channel partners. Lenovo plans to cut prices on x86 products in order to gain market share. This goes in alliance with IBM's vision of the future around cloud technologies and their own POWER processor architecture.

In March 2017, Lenovo announced it was partnering with Fort Lauderdale, Florida–based software storage virtualization company DataCore to add DataCore's parallel I/O-processing software to Lenovo's storage devices.

Content: As a leading smartphone manufacturer globally, Huawei generated revenue of about 233 billion yuan from its consumer business in 2024.

**Revenue of Huawei**

Huawei is a Chinese multinational technology company, which mainly produces telecommunication services and equipment, with smartphones being one of the companies most popular products sold worldwide. The headquarters is located in Shenzhen, the major technological advancement hub in China. In the last few years, Huawei has shifted its business focus from carrier network to technological innovations. With this transition, both the revenue and the net profit of Huawei surged in the same period, increasing three-fold, though China is still the primary market; the largest share of Huawei’s revenue.

**Smartphone business of Huawei**

As Huawei’s smartphones were introduced to various key markets worldwide, Huawei’s brand recognition enhanced a lot. In the first quarter of 2012, the company’s smartphone shipments accounted for around three percent globally, a...

**Huawei’s 2024 Performance: Trading Billions in Profit for a Shot at Technological Sovereignty**

**Is Huawei Sacrificing Today’s Profit to Buy Tomorrow’s Dominance?**

In an era where short-term performance drives stock prices and executive bonuses, Huawei is taking a radically different route—one paved with steep R&D bills, razor-thin operating margins, and a laser focus on China. The company’s 2024 annual report revealed RMB 862.1 billion ($119B) in revenue—up 22.4% year-on-year—but also flagged a troubling slide in profitability. Behind the double-digit growth lies a bold strategic gamble: to trade immediate profits for long-term control over critical technologies in AI, cloud, and automotive.

This is more than a growth story—it’s a declaration of economic self-reliance in response to geopolitical pressure. Huawei is making a high-stakes move to build a full-stack ecosystem independent of Western technology...

# Statement on Compliance with Export Control Regulations

One of the core principles adopted by Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Huawei") is to abide by all applicable export control laws and regulations; fulfill export control obligations and responsibilities; and sustain Huawei's corporate commitment to being an honest and responsible enterprise deserving of trust from its customers, suppliers, and other partners. Huawei believes that compliance with applicable export control laws and regulations enables the company to mitigate trade compliance risks and guarantee Huawei's continued success.

Huawei has established and implemented its internal compliance program (ICP) based on a "catch-all" control regime, and prioritizes export control obligations above commercial interests. If Huawei believes that products, technologies, or services to be exported, whether ta...

Content: US President Donald Trump’s administration has intensified its crackdown on Huawei, issuing global warnings on Tuesday (May 13) that any use of the Chinese technology giant’s artificial intelligence (AI) chips could trigger criminal penalties under US export control laws.

The guidance, issued by the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), clarified that Huawei’s Ascend processors, specifically the 910B, 910C, and 910D, are subject to strict export controls because they are believed to be designed or manufactured using US-origin technology.

The BIS stated, “Using Huawei Ascend chips anywhere in the world violates US export controls.” The announcement serves as a public confirmation rather than a new regulation. It reinforces existing export laws that prohibit the use of US technology by blacklisted entities without proper licensing.

### Why are Huawei’s Ascend chips under scrutiny?

Regarding the second point, Chinese sources and leaders are expressing renewed optimism.

Content: # U.S. Declares Use of Huawei AI Chips Globally Violates Export Laws

AI and Data Science Newsposted by ODSC Team May 14, 2025 ODSC Team

The U.S. government has issued a strong warning regarding the use of Huawei Technologies Co.’s Ascend AI chips. According to new guidance from the Commerce Department, using these chips anywhere in the world violates U.S. export controls.

The announcement by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) on Tuesday significantly ramps up the United States’ efforts to block China’s advancement in AI technology.

### Washington Seeks to Limit Chinese AI Progress

The BIS warned that it would also caution the public about the “

*potential consequences of allowing U.S. AI chips to be used for training and inference of Chinese AI models.*”

Training involves exposing AI systems to large datasets to help them learn patterns, while inference refers to applying that training to real-world tasks. The U.S. sees both phases as critical points where advanced chip technology can enhance Ch...

Content: **Despite sanctions, Huawei grows 22% to $118.3bn in 2024.** **But margins tighter as R&D investment in AI and cars bites.**

Huawei has dealt a stunning blow to US technology restrictions, reporting a massive 860 billion yuan ($118.3 billion) in revenue for 2024.

The Chinese tech giant’s 22% year-over-year surge – its strongest since 2016 – demonstrates how trade sanctions have unexpectedly fuelled rather than hindered its growth.

What makes the financial triumph particularly intriguing is Huawei’s strategic repositioning. While many expected the company to falter under US sanctions that cut off access to advanced semiconductors and critical technologies, Huawei instead concentrated on innovation.

The company’s chairman, Howard Liang Hua, attributes the company’s success to explosive growth in consumer electronics and a rapidly expanding smart car division. However, the transformation came at a cost – net profits declined 13.7% to 62.9 billion yuan in the first nine months of 2024, reflecting massive R&D ...
