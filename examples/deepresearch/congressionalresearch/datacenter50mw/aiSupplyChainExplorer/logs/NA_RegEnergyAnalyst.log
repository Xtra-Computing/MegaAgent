Content: **FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE | ** December 2, 2024 ** | **Media Contact: [email protected]... ## Commerce Strengthens Export Controls to Restrict China’s Capability to Produce Advanced Semiconductors for Military ApplicationsDownload as PDF

**Washington, D.C.** – Today, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) announced a package of rules designed to further impair the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) capability to produce advanced-node semiconductors that can be used in the next generation of advanced weapon systems and in artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced computing, which have significant military applications. This action is a proactive measure enhancing the Department of Commerce’s work to impede the PRC’s ability to procure and produce the technologies necessary for its military modernization.

On December 2, 2024, the Biden administration published two new (with more evidently still to come) updates to the China AI and semiconductor export controls that it released in October 2022. As with the first Trump administration—which made major changes to semiconductor export control policy during its final months in office—these late-term Biden export controls are a bombshell. At a high level, the new controls take eight major actions:

- Expanding country-wide chip-level export controls to restrict High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM), a type of memory that is critical for AI applications;

- Updating the list of advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment (SME) that is restricted on a country-wide basis to include additional equipment for producing HBM, DRAM, and advanced packaging;

- Updating the list of SME that is restricted on an end-use and end-user basis to include additional chokepoint technologies;

Content: ## The current tariff framework

In early April, the United States updated import tariffs for end products from approximately 90 countries before announcing a 90-day pause for implementation. A 10 percent tariff on goods from these countries remains in place during this period. China was the lone exception (Exhibit 2). Further, in March, the United States used its authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to raise steel and aluminum tariffs to 25 percent (up from 10 percent) for all nations, which could affect companies pursuing major construction projects. In response to tariffs placed on Chinese exports to the United States, the China Semiconductor Industry Association (CSIA) issued a notice stating the country of origin for integrated circuits will be determined by the location of the wafer fabrication plant (or the country where the “last substantial transformation” occurred).

Content: How can the United States maximize its international competitiveness in the development of artificial intelligence (AI)? To begin with, it can take additional steps to strengthen domestic chip fabrication capacity and friend-shore supply chains. Washington could also tighten export controls on some semiconductors and other technologies. But imposing new tariffs on essential dual-use, militarily relevant AI components from friendly partners risks having the opposite effect.

The Trump administration has launched an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act into the impact of semiconductor imports on national security, a step toward imposing tariffs. But if it moves ahead with tariffs on all semiconductor imports, the United States would raise hardware costs for US AI firms, punish important partners such as Mexico and Taiwan, and lower prices for Chinese competitors. Tariffs targeted at China have their uses in the US-China tech competition, but they shouldn’t be applied haphazardly to US alli...

Content: On Wednesday, Trump proposed a 100 percent tariff on semiconductors that could raise the cost of AI servers by as much as 75 percent, disrupting data center economics and pricing smaller firms out of frontier AI development. Current and proposed tariff policies already threaten $75–100 billion in additional AI infrastructure costs over five years, equivalent to 15–20 fewer hyperscale facilities. The United States’ competitive advantage lies in AI-enabled services that generate high-value exports, not semiconductor manufacturing, making infrastructure cost increases particularly damaging to U.S. economic interests.

The United States is in the midst of an unprecedented AI infrastructure buildout.

## US AI chip export restrictions are reshaping the global semiconductor market. Learn how these changes impact leading AI chip manufacturers and suppliers.

The recent US AI chip export restrictions have caused a stir in the tech industry. As the US government tightens its control over the export of certain technologies, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, many companies are left wondering what this means for US tech trade. According to the

**US export data** and **US AI chip export data**, the total value of US AI chip exports reached **$57.5 billion in 2024**. In this article, we will explore the implications of these AI chip restrictions or AI chip ban and how they may impact the future of US tech trade.

Content: ## Background

The U.S.'s domestic production is less than its domestic consumption. Its imports therefore exceed its exports and its current account is in deficit. Continuing through at least 2024, the global current account deficit is almost entirely composed of the U.S.
Conversely, China's domestic production is greater than its domestic consumption. Its exports therefore exceed its imports, and its current account is in surplus. Its share of the global trade surplus increased rapidly after China's joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. As of at least 2024, the global current account surplus is largely composed of China, Europe, and the Middle East.... According to the administration, the Chinese government's reforms have been minimal and have not been fair and reciprocal: "After years of U.S.-China dialogues that produced minimal results and commitments that China did not honor, the United States is taking action to confront China over its state-led, market-distorting forced technology transfers, i...

According to the administration, the Chinese government\'s reforms have been minimal and have not been fair and reciprocal: "After years of U.S.-China dialogues that produced minimal results and commitments that China did not honor, the United States is taking action to confront China over its state-led, market-distorting forced technology transfers, i...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'}

## Clean electricity transition continued as demand rose

#### In 2024, wind and solar together generated more electricity than coal for the first time in the US, while solar rose more than gas to meet increased demand growth.

The United States’ shift towards clean electricity continued in 2024, as wind and solar together rose to 17% of total electricity generation, surpassing coal, which dropped to an all-time low of 15%.

After nearly 14 years of stagnation, electricity demand is now firmly rising. It increased by 3%, marking the fifth-highest rise this century, partly as a rebound to a milder summer in 2023, when electricity demand fell by 1.3%. Rising demand drove an increase in ...

### Electricity demand rose 3% in 2024 after years of stagnation. Solar, wind and gas all rose to meet the rise in demand and offset a small fall in coal generation.... ### Demand rising fast, but not yet surging

Electricity demand growth in the US had been near-stagnant for 14 years from 2008 to 2021 (averaging 0.1% per year). However, in 2024, it rose by 3.0% (+128 TWh), following a 1.3% fall in 2023. This marked the fifth highest level of demand growth this century.

The country’s GDP rose by 2.8% and the population by 1%, both not unusually high compared to the period of stagnant electricity demand, therefore the rise in demand cannot be fully attributed to these factors.

A much hotter summer in 2024 compared to a mild one in 2023, explains some of the increase. According to Ember’s modelling, 25 TWh out of 128 TWh of the electricity demand rise in 2024 can be attributed to the difference in temperature compared to 2023.

Title: Electricity Rates by State (October 2025)
URL: https://poweroutage.us/electricity-rates
Content: ## Most expensive states for electricity

States like Hawaii, Massachusetts, California, and Alaska tend to have some of the most expensive electricity in the nation.

Different factors make these states expensive. In Hawaii, higher bills stem from the island's reliance on expensive imported fuel, while Alaskan residents face similar challenges due to remote distribution networks.

Looking at Northeastern states, customers deal with markets that have limited regional competition. Across all these high-cost regions, you're also paying for the inefficiencies of aging grid infrastructure.

AI data centers uniquely challenge grid operations because they can create large, concentrated clusters of 24/7 power demand. Some of the leading data center growth regions have experienced harmonic distortions, load relief warnings and near-miss incidents, and generation shutdowns.

At the same time, the constellation of data center markets is changing. AI infrastructure development is spreading to more states and decentralizing as AI models are deployed closer to users to provide faster responses (figure 3).

Indeed, an April 2025 Deloitte survey of 120 US-based power company and data center executives shows that grid stress was the leading challenge for data center infrastructure development (see methodology). Seventy-nine percent of respondents said that AI will increase power demand through 2035 due to widespread adoption (figure 4).

The semiconductor sector is at a pivotal juncture, with U.S. export controls reshaping global AI dynamics. NVIDIA, the linchpin of this industry, faces a stark dilemma: its $5.5 billion write-down for the H20 chip—once seen as a China-compliant AI solution—now underscores the volatility of navigating regulatory minefields. Yet, beneath the immediate pain lies a strategic opportunity for U.S. firms that leverage geolocation technology and geopolitical alignment to secure long-term dominance. For investors, this is a call to recognize that survival hinges not on avoiding risks but on mastering them.

Title: NVIDIA could face $5.5Bn export control costs

Content: The ongoing trade dispute between the US and China escalated further this week, as NVIDIA confirmed it would face a substantial $5.5bn (£4.2bn) financial impact following tighter US export controls on advanced semiconductors.

The chipmaker, which has played a pivotal role in the recent artificial intelligence (AI) surge, disclosed that its H20 AI processor – one of its most sought-after products in China – would now require a licence for export to the country, including Hong Kong. The decision followed official communication from the US government last week, with NVIDIA warning that the licensing requirement would remain in place “for the indefinite future.”

In a statement, the company explained: “The [government] indicated that the licence requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.”

Editor’s note (1): Shortly after this piece was published, NVIDIA disclosed that the US government had informed it that the export of H20 chips violates supercomputer end-use restrictions, as we assess in this piece. This means that the first recommendation in this piece (that BIS send NVIDIA an “is-informed” letter) is no longer necessary.

Title: U.S. wholesale electricity prices were lower and less volatile in 2024 - EIAwww.eia.gov › todayinenergy › detail
URL: https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64284
Content: Average wholesale electricity prices at major trading hubs in the Lower 48 states were lower in 2024 than in 2023. In addition, prices were much less volatile than they have been over the last few years. Lower and more stable electricity prices in 2024 were mostly driven by low natural gas prices, as well as increases in generation for some lower cost renewable energy sources and new battery storage capacity.

Prices were highest in January, as a result of lower-than-usual temperatures in most of the Lower 48 states, especially in the Northwest. Cold weather increased natural gas consumption and prices, which increased prices for natural gas-fired electricity. After January, natural gas prices traded significantly lower on average during the rest of the year. Benchmark Henry Hub spot prices averaged $2.21 per million British thermal units, the lowest average annual price in inflation-adjusted dollars ever reported, contributing to moderate wholesale electricity prices in all regions. Price changes for natural...

Content: In 2024, the United States produced a record amount of energy, according to data in our

*Monthly Energy Review*. U.S. total energy production was more than 103 quadrillion British thermal units in 2024, a 1% increase from the previous record set in 2023. Several energy sources—natural gas, crude oil, natural gas plant liquids, biofuels, solar, and wind—each set domestic production records last year.

Natural gas accounted for about 38% of U.S. total energy production in 2024 and has been the largest source of U.S. domestic energy production every year since 2011, when it surpassed coal. U.S. dry natural gas production was nearly 38 trillion cubic feet, about the same as in 2023.

Domestic crude oil accounted for about 27% of U.S. total energy production in 2024, as the United States continues to be the world’s top crude oil-producing country. U.S. crude oil production was a record 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024, 2% more than the previous record set in 2023. Almost all of the production growth came from...

Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports, no. 1096 
April 2024; revised February 2025 
https://doi.org/10.59576/sr.1096 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Abstract 
To safeguard its technological leadership, the U.S. has restricted domestic suppliers from exporting 
specific cutting-edge technologies to selected Chinese firms. Domestic firms affected by these export 
controls halt sales to Chinese customers, as intended, but struggle to establish new relations with 
alternative customers domestically or in politically aligned regions. As a result, domestic suppliers 
experience a $130 billion decline in market capitalization, along with reductions in profitability, 
employment, and bank lending. We also show how Chinese firms strategically respond to export controls. 
Overall, export controls impose significant costs on domestic firms producing the very technologies these 
policies in...

Content: Two additional criteria were introduced to close potential loopholes. A performance Density requirement (TPP/die area) was added to target chips that, while physically smaller and thus having lower absolute computing power, achieved computing efficiency on par with the most performant chips. Additionally, a datacenter criterion was implemented to address chips designed for networking in large-scale systems, recognizing that advanced AI training relies not on individual chip performance but on the efficient clustering of many chips within datacenters.

In addition, following U.S. diplomatic efforts in March 2023, the Netherlands agreed to restrict exports of the most advanced DUV machines (specifically the NXT:2000i) capable of manufacturing chips at 14 nm and below, as well as tools that could be used for multi-patterning techniques to potentially achieve 7 nm or below.

Content: The restrictions were not, however, an isolated act. They follow in the wake of a 2019 ban by the administration of President Donald Trump on U.S. companies’ delivery of goods and services to Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei without export licenses, effectively cutting off Huawei’s access to key U.S. semiconductors. Reflecting a growing policy consensus, President Joe Biden tightened these restrictions in 2022.

In addition, the Biden administration has further restricted outbound investment. In a major move, on August 9, 2023, President Biden signed an executive order to create a mechanism for restricting outbound investment in the semiconductor, quantum information, and AI sectors in foreign “countries of concern,” a designation that includes China. The Department of Treasury, responding to the executive order on outbound investment, is preparing to establish outbound restrictions on U.S. investments in Chinese AI sectors critical to military, intelligence, surveillance, and cyber-enabled capabilities...

Content: Many observers and government officials expressed optimism about the US effort. The Biden administration negotiated technology controls with a set of countries that are both key players in the semiconductor sector and among America’s closest allies and partners. Sullivan described export controls as “a new strategic asset in the US and allied toolkit to impose costs on adversaries, and even over time degrade their battlefield capabilities.”3 Media coverage and commentary often amplified this optimism. Biden’s restrictions were deemed “a painful blow” that “hobbled” or “dropped the hammer on China’s semiconductor industry,”4 while Trump administration sanctions on Huawei were called a “lethal blow to the Chinese tech champion” that left the company “crippled,” “kneecapped,” or “decimated.”5 Observers report that export controls created equipment shortages for Chinese chipmakers, resulting in severe bottlenecks and limited yields of usable chips.6

Natural gas accounted for about 38% of U.S. total energy production in 2024 and has been the largest source of U.S. domestic energy production every year since 2011, when it surpassed coal. U.S. dry natural gas production was nearly 38 trillion cubic feet, about the same as in 2023.

Domestic crude oil accounted for about 27% of U.S. total energy production in 2024, as the United States continues to be the world’s top crude oil-producing country. U.S. crude oil production was a record 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024, 2% more than the previous record set in 2023. Almost all of the production growth came from...

Content: ## AI Revolution Transforms Electricity Demand and Power Grids

The U.S. electric grid is facing unprecedented challenges as electricity demand is expected to grow much faster than previously anticipated. The drivers of this surge in electricity demand are multifaceted. At the forefront is massive investment in facilities with large power loads, including manufacturing and industrial facilities and especially data centers supporting AI. The reshoring of U.S. manufacturing spurred by initiatives like the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act is also a driving factor. Since 2021, for example, annual construction spending on new U.S. manufacturing facilities has more than doubled. The electrification of transportation and buildings and the increasing frequency of severe weather events further contribute to this trend.

The expected rise in electricity demand signals a significant departure from the previous era of flat power demand and presents a new challenge for grid planners and policymakers. ...

Content: # Demand and supply changes in 2024

### Electricity demand rose 3% in 2024 after years of stagnation. Solar, wind and gas all rose to meet the rise in demand and offset a small fall in coal generation.... ### Demand rising fast, but not yet surging

Electricity demand growth in the US had been near-stagnant for 14 years from 2008 to 2021 (averaging 0.1% per year). However, in 2024, it rose by 3.0% (+128 TWh), following a 1.3% fall in 2023. This marked the fifth highest level of demand growth this century.

The country’s GDP rose by 2.8% and the population by 1%, both not unusually high compared to the period of stagnant electricity demand, therefore the rise in demand cannot be fully attributed to these factors.

A much hotter summer in 2024 compared to a mild one in 2023, explains some of the increase. According to Ember’s modelling, 25 TWh out of 128 TWh of the electricity demand rise in 2024 can be attributed to the difference in temperature compared to 2023. The analysis quantifies the extent to which hi...

Content: system-level solutions combine NAND, a controller, firmware, and in some cases DRAM.
DRAM: DRAM products are dynamic random access memory semiconductor devices with low latency that provide high-speed data retrieval
with a variety of performance characteristics. DRAM products lose content when power is turned off (“volatile”) and are most commonly used
in the data center, client PC, graphics, industrial, and automotive markets.
In 2023, we began shipping the industry’s first 1β (1-beta) production node, which offers further improvements in power efficiency and bit
density. The majority of our DRAM bit production in 2024 was on leading-edge 1α (1-alpha) and 1ß nodes. We expect volume shipments in
2025 of our next generation of DRAM, the 1γ (1-gamma) node, which will employ EUV lithography production.

Title: Another Update on Micron Electric Needs
URL: https://pragmaticenvironmentalistofnewyork.blog/2023/08/29/another-update-on-micron-electric-needs/
Content: In early March I posted an article about the addressed the energy needs of Micron Technology’s planned semiconductor fabrication plant. The takeaway message was that, when fully complete, the facility will consume more energy than the State of Vermont. As part of their environmental impact analysis, it was recently revealed that more electric power will be needed. More as in add the electric load of New Hampshire. Earlier this month I did an article on this. This post references an article by James Hanley at the Empire Center that describes other potential ramifications.... The cap and invest initiative is one of those recommendations.

**Micron vs NY Energy Policy**

James Hanley writes:

Computer chip manufacturer Micron has revealed that by the 2040s its Onondaga County factories are going to be sucking up enough electricity to power New Hampshire and Vermont combined. Put another way, in a single year Micron will use enough energy to power the city of Buffalo for more than six years.

Title: Energy Density and Micron - Pragmatic Environmentalist of New York
URL: https://pragmaticenvironmentalistofnewyork.blog/2023/12/09/energy-density-and-micron/
Content: In 2022, Micron announced its plans to build the largest semiconductor fabrication facility in the history of the United States. Micron intends to invest up to $100 billion over the next 20-plus years to construct a new chip fab plant in Clay, New York. A recent letter to the Editor of the Syracuse Post-Standard posed the questions: I wonder why the citizens of our state must be the sole providers of electricity to Micron? Shouldn’t Micron at least share in producing electrical power? The author went on to make recommendations that are inconsistent with the energy density of wind and solar that relate to the viability of the venture. This post documents the response I submitted to that letter.

I am following developments at Micron because the facility is going to be built within five miles of my home. I also follow the Climate Leadership & Community Protection Act (Climate Act) because of its impacts on New York. The letter relates to both interests. The opinions expressed in this post do not reflect the pos...

Title: [PDF] Supermicro Export Compliance Policy – Updated December 2024
URL: https://www.supermicro.com/about/policies/Export_Controls_Statement.pdf
Content: 2 
 
 
Introduction 
 
U.S. export control regulations are designed to protect the national security interests of the 
United States and promote foreign policy, including ensuring U.S. controlled commodities and 
technology do not fall into the hands of countries and/or individuals where such use or 
possession could be averse to the United States. 
 
These laws generally govern “exports” or “re-exports” of goods, services and technologies and 
determine what can be exported, to whom it can be exported, for what use it can be exported and 
whether prior approval from the U.S. government (in the form of an export license) is required 
before the export or re-export takes place. 
 
It is Supermicro’s obligation to comply with these laws when undertaking any export, re-export 
or other related activity subject to U.S. and Global export controls laws. 
 
Failure to comply with U.S. and Global export regulations may expose Supermicro and 
individual employees to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including ...

Content: # Super Micro Computer: A High-Risk Bet Amid Accounting Scandals and Governance FailuresWritten byClyde Morgan

- Super Micro (SMCI) faces governance crises amid AI growth, with 2024 accounting scandals and SEC/DOJ investigations eroding investor trust.

- EY resigned as auditor over transparency concerns, triggering a 30% stock drop, while material control weaknesses persist in 2025.

- AI revenue surged 43% to $3.19B in Q2 2025, driven by NVIDIA GPU servers and Saudi partnerships, but margins fell to 9.6% in Q3.

- Management reforms and BDO audit engagement aim to restore confidence, though analysts estimate 12-18 months for trust recovery.

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) has emerged as a polarizing figure in the AI infrastructure sector, with its meteoric rise in 2025 overshadowed by a shadow of corporate governance failures and regulatory scrutiny. While the company’s AI-driven growth narrative has attracted investor optimism, the lingering questions about its financial integrity and internal controls deman...

URL: https://www.csis.org/analysis/limits-chip-export-controls-meeting-china-challenge
Content: The U.S. government and those of its allies have imposed and progressively tightened controls on the export of semiconductor technology, devices, and tools to China in an effort to maintain U.S. leadership in this critical sector. China has responded with an all-out effort to stimulate domestic chip innovation capabilities and eliminate dependency on foreign sources. The outcome of the chip innovation race will determine which country leads in the development and application of AI, with major strategic and economic security implications.

Preventing China from acquiring the most advanced chip technology makes sense from a national security perspective, but export restrictions alone cannot substitute for comprehensive industrial and research policy measures necessary to ensure U.S. leadership in semiconductor design, production, and infrastructure. Moreover, the imposition of export controls has resulted in China doubling down on its existing deeply subsidized development efforts that could well produce breakt...

Content: ## Controversy

In 2006, Supermicro pleaded guilty to a felony charge and paid a $150,000 fine due to a violation of a United States embargo against the sale of computer systems to Iran. In a plea agreement, it was acknowledged that Supermicro became aware of the investigation in February 2004 and set up an export-control program that same year.

In November 2021, the joint venture of Super Micro Computer and Fiberhome Telecommunication Technologies won a contract for supplying servers to Xinjiang Bingtuan for 'public safety purposes', which is associated with the suppression of Uyghurs ethnic group and construction of a surveillance system in the province of Xinjiang.

### Server tampering allegation

On October 4, 2018, *Bloomberg Businessweek* published a report, citing unnamed corporate and governmental sources, which claimed that the Chinese People's Liberation Army had forced Supermicro's Chinese sub-contractors to add microchips with hardware backdoors to its servers. The report claimed that the compro...

The global political landscape presents both opportunities and challenges for HPE. International operations are significantly affected by trade policies, government regulations, and political stability.... **Global Political Landscapes:**Geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States and China, continue to impact international trade and supply chains. For example, tariffs on technology components imported from China can increase HPE's production costs. According to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, tariffs on electronics have risen by an average of 15% since 2020, directly affecting companies like HPE that rely on global supply chains. **Government Regulations:**In the US and Europe, stringent regulations on data privacy (e.g., GDPR) and cybersecurity require HPE to invest heavily in compliance measures. The cost of GDPR compliance alone is estimated to be around $1.7 million for large enterprises, according to a 2024 report by the International Associati...

URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_New_Export_Controls_on_Advanced_Computing_and_Semiconductors_to_China
Content: Effective October 7, 2022, the United States of America implemented new export controls targeting the People's Republic of China's (PRC) ability to access and develop advanced computing and semiconductor manufacturing items. The new export controls reflect the United States' ambition to counter the accelerating advancement of China's high-tech capabilities in these spaces to address its foreign policy and national security concerns.

## Background of new export controls

### Huawei and ZTE equipment ban

In August 2018, President Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (NDAA 2019). The act prohibited the use and procurement of Huawei and ZTE equipment from being used by all U.S. federal government executive agencies, citing security concerns. In June 2020 the U.S. federal government officially designated Huawei and ZTE as threats to national security due to their close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and China's military. As for the reasoning for this classification, spoke...

Content: The **Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company** (**HPE**) is an American multinational information technology company based in Spring, Texas. It is a business-focused organization which works in servers, storage, networking, containerization software and consulting and support. HPE was ranked No. 107 in the 2018 *Fortune* 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.

HPE was founded on November 1, 2015, in Palo Alto, California, as part of the splitting of the Hewlett-Packard company. The split was structured so that the former Hewlett-Packard Company would change its name to HP Inc. and spin off Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a newly created company. HP Inc. retained the old HP's personal computer and printing business, as well as its stock-price history and original NYSE ticker symbol for Hewlett-Packard; Enterprise trades under its own ticker symbol: HPE. At the time of the spin-off, HPE's revenue was slightly less than that of HP Inc. The company relocated to Texas in 2020.

Title: HP Inc loves China – but wants to reduce the risks it presents
URL: https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/09/hp_china_supply_chain/
Content: ## Amid reports that plenty of PC production will shift elsewhere, supply chain boss emphasizes agility

HP Inc loves China and wants to keep making and designing products there, but also loves the idea of diversifying its operations to other countries in case geopolitics becomes a problem.

That's the gist of a Thursday post by chief supply chain officer Ernest Nicolas, titled "Transforming and Optimizing Supply Chains."

*The Register* fancies HP Inc. decided to share its views on supply chains after Japanese outlet Nikkei earlier reported the consumer part of HP wants "to shift more than half of its personal computer production away from China … in an attempt to reduce geopolitical risks around China and Taiwan." The report also claims HP Inc. will establish a design hub in Singapore as a backup to its Taiwanese facilities.

Nicolas's post confirms that geopolitical risk is something HP Inc. is considering – as is proper for any multinational organization.

Content: HPE said that it did not believe it had supplied the Chinese military through its joint-venture New H3C, after the business was sanctioned by the US government.

The company told The Register that it was unclear why subsidiary New H3C Semiconductor Technologies Co., Ltd had been added to the Entity List, and that it had yet to hear from the Commerce Department.

The company, a joint venture between HPE and Chinese Tsinghua Unigroup, was added along with 11 other Chinese tech and quantum computing firms late last week. New H3C is the exclusive provider of HPE servers, storage, and associated technical services in China.

“We are reaching out to the Commerce Department to understand why this action was taken,” a spokesperson told the publication. “Given the holiday weekend in the US, we have not yet had the opportunity to discuss this matter in depth with the Commerce Department.”

The spokesperson added: "At this time, our due diligence suggests no indication that sales to the Chinese military have taken place...

Hewlett Packard, commonly known as HP, is a multinational technology company that operates in the servers sector.

Today, HP is headquartered in Palo Alto and has operations in more than 170 countries around the world.

HP is committed to decarbonisation and reducing its environmental impact. The company has set ambitious goals to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and increase its use of renewable energy. In 2019, HP announced that it had achieved its goal of using 100% renewable electricity in its global operations. The company has also set a goal to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2025, compared to its 2015 baseline.

One of the ways that HP is achieving its decarbonisation goals is by investing in corporate energy programs. HP has signed several corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) to buy renewable energy directly from wind and solar farms. These PPAs help to increase the a...

Title: [PDF] CISCO 2024 TCFD Index
URL: https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/m/en_us/about/csr/esg-hub/_pdf/2023-tcfd.pdf
Content: To identify and model risks and opportunities, we considered both quantitative and qualitative factors. The physical assets 
selected for the physical risk analysis were prioritized based on a number of attributes, including location, to help identify the 
significance of the asset to the enterprise. For transition risks and opportunities, crossfunctional surveys and internal interviews 
were also considered.
PHYSICAL RISKS
Our analysis of physical risks focused on identifying potential impacts from climate-related physical hazards facing Cisco 
assets located worldwide, including Cisco-owned and leased facilities, logistics centers, data centers, contract manufacturers, 
and suppliers.
For each asset location, data was collected and processed to include in the physical risk modeling. Physical climate risk was 
quantified using the outputs of global climate models for historical baseline periods and for future periods using two scenarios 
aligned with Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5).

Trade controls are complex and can vary significantly across countries and jurisdictions. Depending on your location and various other factors, more than one set of country controls may apply to a particular transaction or product. Compliance with one country’s controls doesn’t relieve you or your duty to comply with the controls of another country to which any export, re-export, import or use of the product applies. Export controls commonly include the following prohibitions:

- Export to embargoed countries or regions and sanctioned parties

- Use of products or technology to support prohibited activities

- Unlicensed export of controlled products to locations not otherwise generally embargoed or to end users not otherwise sanctioned

- License-required exports in violation of conditions or restrictions imposed by the license

Title: Sustainable Networks: powering the future, responsibly
URL: https://blogs.juniper.net/en-us/industry-solutions-and-trends/sustainable-networks-powering-the-future-responsibly
Content: Imagine a data center humming with 100,000 cutting-edge GPUs, the backbone of the AI/ML and Gen AI revolution. The energy required for processing, cooling, and networking such a facility can easily reach 150 megawatts—enough to power 100,000-120,000 households. This staggering consumption, and the strain it places on local power grids, highlights a critical challenge: the growing environmental footprint of our digital world. U.S. Department of Energy projections paint a stark picture: data center electricity consumption in the U.S. is expected to surge to 6.7%-12% of total usage by 2028 – a dramatic increase from 58 TWh in 2014 to a projected 325-580 TWh by 2028.

*Chart Source: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory US Data Center Energy Usage Report 2024*

The energy required for processing, cooling, and networking such a facility can easily reach 150 megawatts—enough to power 100,000-120,000 households. This staggering consumption, and the strain it places on local power grids, highlights a critical challenge: the growing environmental footprint of our digital world. U.S. Department of Energy projections paint a stark picture: data center electricity consumption in the U.S. is expected to surge to 6.7%-12% of total usage by 2028 – a dramatic increase from 58 TWh in 2014 to a projected 325-580 TWh by 2028.\n\n*Chart Source: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory US Data Center Energy Usage Report 2024*\n\nThis exponential growth demands immediate, sustainable solutions particularly in networking infrastructure, where both performance and environmental impact are important.\n\n**The evolution of data center networks: from redundancy to responsibility**\n\nTradit...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}

**BIS Expands The Scope of the Foreign Direct Product Rule Concerning Iran**

July 24, 2024: The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) implemented an expansion of controls on the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of certain foreign-produced items located in or destined to Iran, to address ongoing concerns regarding Iran’s potential use of U.S. technology in weapons systems.

This rule implements the requirements of the No Technology for Terror Act (the Act), which was passed in April as part of emergency supplemental appropriations for the current fiscal year. As required by the Act, the BIS rule expands the scope of the Export Administration Regulations’ (EAR) Iran Foreign Direct Product rule (FDPR). The expansion, effective July 23, 2024, is designed to further impede Iran’s ability to procure technology and components critical for military systems, including advanced drones that pose threats to U.S. forces and allies.

Content: On September 6, the Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) in the U.S. Commerce Department issued an interim final rule (“IFR”)[1] under the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) to add new export controls on semiconductor, quantum computing, and additive manufacturing items for national security and foreign policy reasons. The IFR’s effective date was September 6, 2024, subject to certain exceptions. The new IFR includes a number of novel export license requirements as well as the creation of an entirely new type of license exception that apply to countries that have adopted comparable export controls, which may signal a new turn by the United States toward plurilateral controls rather than traditional multilateral export control regimes among U.S. allies that agree with and support such measures.

The semiconductor sector is at a pivotal juncture, with U.S. export controls reshaping global AI dynamics. NVIDIA, the linchpin of this industry, faces a stark dilemma: its $5.5 billion write-down for the H20 chip—once seen as a China-compliant AI solution—now underscores the volatility of navigating regulatory minefields. Yet, beneath the immediate pain lies a strategic opportunity for U.S. firms that leverage geolocation technology and geopolitical alignment to secure long-term dominance. For investors, this is a call to recognize that survival hinges not on avoiding risks but on mastering them.

Content: ##### October 2023

October 17: The US Department of Commerce updated its export compliance for advanced semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The government said:

“Today’s rules reinforce the October 7, 2022, controls to restrict the PRC’s ability to both purchase and manufacture certain high-end chips critical for military advantage. These updates are necessary to maintain the effectiveness of these controls, close loopholes, and ensure they remain durable.”

The U.S. government has removed interconnect speed as a criterion for identifying restricted chips. Instead, it will now focus on processor performance and performance density. In a statement, the government said:

“A performance density parameter prevents the workaround of simply purchasing a larger number of smaller datacenter AI chips which, if combined, would be equally powerful as restricted chips.”

Recommendations

- 1. BIS should stop the H20 shipments

- 2. NVIDIA should ensure its compliance with supercomputer end-use restrictions

- 3. BIS should issue a new rule strengthening export controls on inference chips

- 4. The White House should set up a team to monitor and respond to the rapidly changing threat environment

- 5. BIS should track chips after they have been exported

- Technical appendices

Editor’s note (1): Shortly after this piece was published, NVIDIA disclosed that the US government had informed it that the export of H20 chips violates supercomputer end-use restrictions, as we assess in this piece. This means that the first recommendation in this piece (that BIS send NVIDIA an “is-informed” letter) is no longer necessary.

Content: The boom in generative AI, powered by transformers, will indeed need a lot of transformers, generators and a myriad of other electrical and cooling widgets.

A lot of back of the envelope guesstimates or straight up alarmist narratives are based on outdated research. The IEA’s recent Electricity 2024 report suggests 90 terawatt-hours (TWh) of power demand from AI Datacenters by 2026, which is equivalent to about 10 Gigawatts (GW) of Datacenter Critical IT Power Capacity, or the equivalent of 7.3M H100s. We estimate that Nvidia alone will have shipped accelerators with the power needs of 5M+ H100s (mostly shipments of H100s, in fact) from 2021 through the end of 2024, and we see AI Datacenter capacity demand crossing above 10 GW by early 2025.

The above report is an underestimation of datacenter power demand, but there are plenty of overestimates too – some from the alarmist camp have recycled old papers written before the widespread adoption of accelerated compute that point to a worst-case scenario with dat...

Content: power sustainably and cost-effectively. NVIDIA accelerated computing has reached an inflection point. NVIDIA is modernizing the world’s trillion-dollar data center industry. By accelerating workloads with NVIDIA GPUs operating in parallel, we exponentially increase throughput while driving down the total energy used to complete a task and, thus, the total cost of ownership. The energy savings are incredible. Accelerated computing took workloads that previously required tens of thousands of general-purpose servers, consuming 10X to 20X more cost and energy and compressed it into something incredibly dense. Each GPU server is more costly and consumes more power, but an order of magnitude fewer servers are needed. So, there are enormous money and energy savings when we look at the actual work done or throughput. That is precisely why, as CPU scaling has slowed, we must transition to accelerated computing—we... cannot continue scaling out the traditional way. Accelerated computing is essential.

The IEA’s recent Electricity 2024 report suggests 90 terawatt-hours (TWh) of power demand from AI Datacenters by 2026, which is equivalent to about 10 Gigawatts (GW) of Datacenter Critical IT Power Capacity, or the equivalent of 7.3M H100s. We estimate that Nvidia alone will have shipped accelerators with the power needs of 5M+ H100s (mostly shipments of H100s, in fact) from 2021 through the end of 2024, and we see AI Datacenter capacity demand crossing above 10 GW by early 2025.\n\nThe above report is an underestimation of datacenter power demand, but there are plenty of overestimates too – some from the alarmist camp have recycled old papers written before the widespread adoption of accelerated compute that point to a worst-case scenario with dat...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 2:\nTitle: Corporate Sustainability | NVIDIA\nURL: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/sustainability/\nContent: AI Enhanced\n\nOur innovations in AI and accelerated computing are setting new standards for environmental responsibility while powering a greener, more sustainable future.\n\nNVIDIA powers the top supercomputer on the November 2024 Green500 list.\n\nNVIDIA Blackwell GPUs are generally over 50x more energy efficient than traditional CPUs for LLM AI inference workloads.\n\nNVIDIA DPUs can reduce power consumption by offloading essential data center networking and infrastructure functions from less-efficient CPUs.\n\nIn FY25, we achieved and will maintain 100% renewable electricity for offices and data centers under our operational control.

NVIDIA accelerated computing has reached an inflection point. NVIDIA is modernizing the world’s trillion-dollar data center industry. By accelerating workloads with NVIDIA GPUs operating in parallel, we exponentially increase throughput while driving down the total energy used to complete a task and, thus, the total cost of ownership. The energy savings are incredible. Accelerated computing took workloads that previously required tens of thousands of general-purpose servers, consuming 10X to 20X more cost and energy and compressed it into something incredibly dense. Each GPU server is more costly and consumes more power, but an order of magnitude fewer servers are needed. So, there are enormous money and energy savings when we look at the actual work done or throughput. That is precisely why, as CPU scaling has slowed, we must transition to accelerated computing—we... cannot continue scaling out the traditional way. Accelerated computing is essential.

Title: U.S. AI Chip Export Restrictions: Impact on Nvidia, AMD
URL: https://www.cimphony.ai/insights/us-ai-chip-export-restrictions-impact-on-nvidia-amd
Content: ## 2. AMD

### Affected Chips

The new export restrictions impact AMD's AI chip, the MI250. The company designed a weaker version of the chip to comply with previous export rules, but it was deemed too powerful and required a license from the Commerce Department. AMD's forthcoming MI300 chip is also likely to be affected by the new rules.

### Revenue Impact

The export restrictions may affect AMD's revenue, particularly in the Chinese market. Although the company did not provide a figure for its fourth-quarter China revenue, it warned that any further revisions to the curbs may also bring its relatively slower MI200 chips under licensing requirements, possibly barring their export to China.

### Company Response

AMD has not commented on the impact of the new export restrictions, but it has been working to develop alternative solutions to comply with the regulations. The company's shares fell more than 3% in premarket trading on the news, as investors feared that the reported development could hamper its eff...

Content: This report analyzes the impact of U.S. export restrictions on AMD's sales potential in light of its ambitions in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. With strict regulations targeting advanced AI chips, particularly the Instinct MI308, AMD faces a dire revenue threat, estimated at over $1.5 billion for 2025 alone. As geopolitical tensions escalate, these constraints hinder AMD's competitive positioning in the lucrative Chinese market, potentially resulting in significant operational shifts and financial repercussions throughout the semiconductor landscape. The findings suggest that strategic diversification, a focused pivot toward inference chip production, and proactive engagement with regulatory bodies are critical steps for AMD to mitigate these losses and position itself for future growth.

Additionally, the report outlines three forecasting scenarios: full license approval that could restore lost revenues, partial license approvals introducing uncertainty, and continuation of the existing trade ban ...

AMD\n\n### Affected Chips\n\nThe new export restrictions impact AMD's AI chip, the MI250. The company designed a weaker version of the chip to comply with previous export rules, but it was deemed too powerful and required a license from the Commerce Department. AMD's forthcoming MI300 chip is also likely to be affected by the new rules.\n\n### Revenue Impact\n\nThe export restrictions may affect AMD's revenue, particularly in the Chinese market. Although the company did not provide a figure for its fourth-quarter China revenue, it warned that any further revisions to the curbs may also bring its relatively slower MI200 chips under licensing requirements, possibly barring their export to China.\n\n### Company Response\n\nAMD has not commented on the impact of the new export restrictions, but it has been working to develop alternative solutions to comply with the regulations. The company's shares fell more than 3% in premarket trading on the news, as investors feared that the reported development could hamper its eff...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 6:\nTitle: 2023-24\nURL: https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/corporate/cr/corporate-responsibility-report.pdf\nContent: and inclusion, and supply chain responsibility goals. For example, from 2021 to 2023, more than 150 universities, research institutions, and non-profit organizations focused on scientific research and education received AMD technology donations through our AI and HPC Fund and STEM initiatives. We also reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 24.5% in 2023 compared to our 2020 baseline. And we remain on track to achieve our goal of delivering a 30x increase in energy efciency from 2020 to 2025 for AI training and high-performance computing applications. Looking ahead, AI is the most important innovation of the last 50 years with the potential to transform every aspect of our lives.

The controls apply specifically to AMD’s MI308 GPUs and restrict sales to China, Hong Kong, Macau, and other countries designated under D:5 classifications.\n\nThe company stated it completed an initial assessment of the new license requirement on April 15 and intends to apply for the necessary authorizations but offered no guarantees on approvals. AMD shares fell 6% following the announcement, as similar restrictions have already prompted a $5.5 billion charge from rival NVIDIA.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 8:\nTitle: Assessing the Impact of U.S. Export Restrictions on AMD's Sales ...\nURL: https://seo.goover.ai/report/202508/go-public-report-en-d0c2b0a4-916b-4f79-bb83-524269b9d331-0-0.html\nContent: This report analyzes the impact of U.S. export restrictions on AMD's sales potential in light of its ambitions in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. With strict regulations targeting advanced AI chips, particularly the Instinct MI308, AMD faces a dire revenue threat, estimated at over $1.5 billion for 2025 alone. As geopolitical tensions escalate, these constraints hinder AMD's competitive positioning in the lucrative Chinese market, potentially resulting in significant operational shifts and financial repercussions throughout the semiconductor landscape. The findings suggest that strategic diversification, a focused pivot toward inference chip production, and proactive engagement with regulatory bodies are critical steps for AMD to mitigate these losses and position itself for future growth.\n\nAdditionally, the report outlines three forecasting scenarios: full license approval that could restore lost revenues, partial license approvals introducing uncertainty, and continuation of the existing trade ban ...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}

Abstract 
To safeguard its technological leadership, the U.S. has restricted domestic suppliers from exporting 
specific cutting-edge technologies to selected Chinese firms. Domestic firms affected by these export 
controls halt sales to Chinese customers, as intended, but struggle to establish new relations with 
alternative customers domestically or in politically aligned regions. As a result, domestic suppliers 
experience a $130 billion decline in market capitalization, along with reductions in profitability, 
employment, and bank lending. We also show how Chinese firms strategically respond to export controls. 
Overall, export controls impose significant costs on domestic firms producing the very technologies these

URL: https://www.csis.org/analysis/balancing-ledger-export-controls-us-chip-technology-china
Content: The restrictions were not, however, an isolated act. They follow in the wake of a 2019 ban by the administration of President Donald Trump on U.S. companies’ delivery of goods and services to Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei without export licenses, effectively cutting off Huawei’s access to key U.S. semiconductors. Reflecting a growing policy consensus, President Joe Biden tightened these restrictions in 2022.

In addition, the Biden administration has further restricted outbound investment. In a major move, on August 9, 2023, President Biden signed an executive order to create a mechanism for restricting outbound investment in the semiconductor, quantum information, and AI sectors in foreign “countries of concern,” a designation that includes China. The Department of Treasury, responding to the executive order on outbound investment, is preparing to establish outbound restrictions on U.S. investments in Chinese AI sectors critical to military, intelligence, surveillance, and cyber-enabled capabilities...

Content: On September 6, the Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) in the U.S. Commerce Department issued an interim final rule (“IFR”)[1] under the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) to add new export controls on semiconductor, quantum computing, and additive manufacturing items for national security and foreign policy reasons. The IFR’s effective date was September 6, 2024, subject to certain exceptions. The new IFR includes a number of novel export license requirements as well as the creation of an entirely new type of license exception that apply to countries that have adopted comparable export controls, which may signal a new turn by the United States toward plurilateral controls rather than traditional multilateral export control regimes among U.S. allies that agree with and support such measures.

Content: EXPORT CONTROLS AND US-CHINA TECHNOLOGY COMPETITION IN AN INTERDEPENDENT WORLD
Introduction  
AMERICA’S NEW TRADE AND INDUS-
TRIAL POLICY INTERVENTIONS IN THE 
SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY
OVERVIEW
The export controls on semiconductor technologies 
adopted by the Biden administration and enforced by 
key allies represent a significant shift in the technolog-
ical competition between the U.S. and China. Unlike 
many past efforts, these sanctions are designed not  
to change Chinese behavior but to inhibit the devel-
opment of China’s technological capabilities. These 
sanctions have been paired with extensive subsidies 
designed to build up U.S. firms’ technical capabilities 
and “reshore” semiconductor manufacturing. This 
essay argues that current sanctions and subsidies 
will likely prove inadequate to meet the policy goals of 
the Biden administration or future administrations. It 
suggests alternatives that will reinforce the impact of 
sanctions and make the achievement of those underly-
ing policy objectives ...

They follow in the wake of a 2019 ban by the administration of President Donald Trump on U.S. companies’ delivery of goods and services to Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei without export licenses, effectively cutting off Huawei’s access to key U.S. semiconductors. Reflecting a growing policy consensus, President Joe Biden tightened these restrictions in 2022.\n\nIn addition, the Biden administration has further restricted outbound investment. In a major move, on August 9, 2023, President Biden signed an executive order to create a mechanism for restricting outbound investment in the semiconductor, quantum information, and AI sectors in foreign “countries of concern,” a designation that includes China.

Meeting Compute 
Environment Challenges
In the past, we focused our data center investments 
on improving IT infrastructure to deliver a foundation 
for the efficient growth of Intel’s business. Our primary 
goal was cost reduction through data center efficiency 
and infrastructure simplification while reducing 
energy consumption and our CO2 footprint to 
improve IT sustainability.
Over the last several years, we have reduced data 
center energy consumption and greenhouse gas 
emissions. At the same time, we have met the 
constantly increasing demand for data center 
resources. We anticipate these annual growth 
rates to continue or even increase further:
• 30 to 40% in compute capacity requirements
• 35 to 50% in storage needs 
• 30 to 40% in demand for network capacity 
We needed to address these challenges without 
negatively impacting service delivery. We developed 
and continue to rely on many established industry 
best practices in all areas of our data ce...

Content: The boom in generative AI, powered by transformers, will indeed need a lot of transformers, generators and a myriad of other electrical and cooling widgets.

A lot of back of the envelope guesstimates or straight up alarmist narratives are based on outdated research. The IEA’s recent Electricity 2024 report suggests 90 terawatt-hours (TWh) of power demand from AI Datacenters by 2026, which is equivalent to about 10 Gigawatts (GW) of Datacenter Critical IT Power Capacity, or the equivalent of 7.3M H100s. We estimate that Nvidia alone will have shipped accelerators with the power needs of 5M+ H100s (mostly shipments of H100s, in fact) from 2021 through the end of 2024, and we see AI Datacenter capacity demand crossing above 10 GW by early 2025.

The above report is an underestimation of datacenter power demand, but there are plenty of overestimates too – some from the alarmist camp have recycled old papers written before the widespread adoption of accelerated compute that point to a worst-case scenario with dat...

### US Government Restrictions on Semiconductor Exports to China

In October 2022, the US Department of Commerce implemented comprehensive export controls preventing Micron Technology from selling advanced memory chips to China. These restrictions specifically target advanced DRAM and NAND memory chips with national security implications.

|Export Restriction Details|Impact|
|--|--|
|Chinese Market Revenue Loss|Approximately $2.6 billion in potential annual revenue|
|Affected Product Categories|Advanced memory chips for servers, data centers, and high-performance computing|
### US-China Trade Tensions in Semiconductor Manufacturing

Ongoing geopolitical challenges have significantly impacted Micron's global manufacturing and market strategies.

- China represents approximately 20-25% of Micron's global semiconductor market

- Trade restrictions have forced Micron to diversify supply chain and manufacturing locations

Content: New US tariffs have reportedly prompted Micron to raise prices on memory components. (Photo: Shutterstock)
Micron Technology will begin applying a tariff-related surcharge on selected memory products sold to US customers starting 9 April, according to a Reuters report citing four individuals familiar with the company's plans. The move comes in response to newly introduced tariffs under US President Donald Trump's latest trade measures.
Although the recent announcement by the US administration excluded semiconductors from the new tariff structure, products such as memory modules and solid-state drives (SSDs) have not been exempted. These products, used extensively in computing devices, automotive systems, and enterprise storage, fall within Micron's portfolio and will be subject to a surcharge aimed at offsetting the additional costs associated with the new levies.
Micron conveyed the decision in a communication to its US clients, stating that the new trade conditions made the surcharge necessary. The company ...

Content: On May 21, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) determined that Micron Technology, Inc., a U.S. semiconductor firm, failed its cybersecurity review and that “critical infrastructure operators in China must halt procurement of Micron’s products,” (author’s translation). Many observers and policymakers in the United States view CAC’s decision as thinly veiled retaliation for recent U.S. actions restricting China’s access to advanced semiconductor technologies. The reality may be more complex and call for a more nuanced response from Washington.

It might be tempting for U.S. policymakers to respond forcibly to CAC’s action, retaliating against China or pressuring South Korea to prevent Samsung and SK Hynix, Micron’s primary competitors in China, from “backfilling” demand, i.e., selling similar chips to Micron’s customers. However, either response would play into China’s primary aim in targeting Micron: complicating Washington’s efforts to build an allied coalition to cut off China’s access to advanced s...

April 1, 20234 Min ReadBloomberg

(Bloomberg) -- China has launched a cybersecurity review of imports from America’s largest memory chipmaker, Micron Technology Inc., opening a new front in the escalating battle between the two countries over dominance in the semiconductor market.

The Chinese government is conducting the review to ensure the security of its information infrastructure supply chain, prevent network security risks and maintain national security, it said in a statement Friday. Shares of Micron, which counts on mainland China for about 11% of its sales, fell as much as 5.1% in New York to $59.90.

Title: [PDF] Supermicro Export Compliance Policy – Updated December 2024
URL: https://www.supermicro.com/about/policies/Export_Controls_Statement.pdf
Content: 2 
 
 
Introduction 
 
U.S. export control regulations are designed to protect the national security interests of the 
United States and promote foreign policy, including ensuring U.S. controlled commodities and 
technology do not fall into the hands of countries and/or individuals where such use or 
possession could be averse to the United States. 
 
These laws generally govern “exports” or “re-exports” of goods, services and technologies and 
determine what can be exported, to whom it can be exported, for what use it can be exported and 
whether prior approval from the U.S. government (in the form of an export license) is required 
before the export or re-export takes place. 
 
It is Supermicro’s obligation to comply with these laws when undertaking any export, re-export 
or other related activity subject to U.S. and Global export controls laws. 
 
Failure to comply with U.S. and Global export regulations may expose Supermicro and 
individual employees to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including ...

Title: Supermicro - Wikipedia

Content: ## Controversy

In 2006, Supermicro pleaded guilty to a felony charge and paid a $150,000 fine due to a violation of a United States embargo against the sale of computer systems to Iran. In a plea agreement, it was acknowledged that Supermicro became aware of the investigation in February 2004 and set up an export-control program that same year.

In November 2021, the joint venture of Super Micro Computer and Fiberhome Telecommunication Technologies won a contract for supplying servers to Xinjiang Bingtuan for 'public safety purposes', which is associated with the suppression of Uyghurs ethnic group and construction of a surveillance system in the province of Xinjiang.

### Server tampering allegation

On October 4, 2018, *Bloomberg Businessweek* published a report, citing unnamed corporate and governmental sources, which claimed that the Chinese People's Liberation Army had forced Supermicro's Chinese sub-contractors to add microchips with hardware backdoors to its servers. The report claimed that the compro...

Content: # Super Micro Computer: A High-Risk Bet Amid Accounting Scandals and Governance FailuresWritten byClyde Morgan

- Super Micro (SMCI) faces governance crises amid AI growth, with 2024 accounting scandals and SEC/DOJ investigations eroding investor trust.

- EY resigned as auditor over transparency concerns, triggering a 30% stock drop, while material control weaknesses persist in 2025.

- AI revenue surged 43% to $3.19B in Q2 2025, driven by NVIDIA GPU servers and Saudi partnerships, but margins fell to 9.6% in Q3.

- Management reforms and BDO audit engagement aim to restore confidence, though analysts estimate 12-18 months for trust recovery.

Super Micro Computer (SMCI) has emerged as a polarizing figure in the AI infrastructure sector, with its meteoric rise in 2025 overshadowed by a shadow of corporate governance failures and regulatory scrutiny. While the company’s AI-driven growth narrative has attracted investor optimism, the lingering questions about its financial integrity and internal controls deman...

Title: The Limits of Chip Export Controls in Meeting the China ...
URL: https://www.csis.org/analysis/limits-chip-export-controls-meeting-china-challenge
Content: The U.S. government and those of its allies have imposed and progressively tightened controls on the export of semiconductor technology, devices, and tools to China in an effort to maintain U.S. leadership in this critical sector. China has responded with an all-out effort to stimulate domestic chip innovation capabilities and eliminate dependency on foreign sources. The outcome of the chip innovation race will determine which country leads in the development and application of AI, with major strategic and economic security implications.

Preventing China from acquiring the most advanced chip technology makes sense from a national security perspective, but export restrictions alone cannot substitute for comprehensive industrial and research policy measures necessary to ensure U.S. leadership in semiconductor design, production, and infrastructure. Moreover, the imposition of export controls has resulted in China doubling down on its existing deeply subsidized development efforts that could well produce breakt...

Title: Super Micro: Fresh Evidence Of Accounting Manipulation ...
URL: https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/
Content: Super Micro has seen a 110% year over year increase in revenue growth and a 61% compound annual growth rate over the last 3 financial years. [1, 2, 3]

Sell side consensus forecasts 87% revenue growth in FY 2025, per Bloomberg, predicting rapid further sales growth ahead.

Super Micro’s core offering is an increasingly commoditized product: the server.

“The server is not a feat of engineering”, one former Super Micro executive told us in an interview.

Key to this is that the company now faces major competition in the AI server market from well-established technology giants like Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard. Sell-side analysts have raised concerns that Dell has been selling its AI servers at “near-zero margins” to remain competitive, as reported by CNBC.

In August 2024, Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn announced that it planned for AI servers to be its next “trillion [Taiwanese]-dollar revenue product”.

Super Micro also faces cost competition from less expensive Taiwanese “ODMs” (original des...

Moreover, the imposition of export controls has resulted in China doubling down on its existing deeply subsidized development efforts that could well produce breakt...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 7:\nTitle: Super Micro: Fresh Evidence Of Accounting Manipulation ...\nURL: https://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/\nContent: Super Micro has seen a 110% year over year increase in revenue growth and a 61% compound annual growth rate over the last 3 financial years. [1, 2, 3]\n\nSell side consensus forecasts 87% revenue growth in FY 2025, per Bloomberg, predicting rapid further sales growth ahead.\n\nSuper Micro’s core offering is an increasingly commoditized product: the server.\n\n“The server is not a feat of engineering”, one former Super Micro executive told us in an interview.\n\nKey to this is that the company now faces major competition in the AI server market from well-established technology giants like Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard. Sell-side analysts have raised concerns that Dell has been selling its AI servers at “near-zero margins” to remain competitive, as reported by CNBC.\n\nIn August 2024, Taiwanese manufacturing giant Foxconn announced that it planned for AI servers to be its next “trillion [Taiwanese]-dollar revenue product”.\n\nSuper Micro also faces cost competition from less expensive Taiwanese “ODMs” (original des...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 8:\nTitle: Supermicro - Wikipedia\nURL: https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Super_Micro_Computer%2C_Inc.\nContent: ## Controversy\n\nIn 2006, Supermicro pleaded guilty to a felony charge and paid a $150,000 fine due to a violation of a United States embargo against the sale of computer systems to Iran. In a plea agreement, it was acknowledged that Supermicro became aware of the investigation in February 2004 and set up an export-control program that same year.\n\nIn November 2021, the joint venture of Super Micro Computer and Fiberhome Telecommunication Technologies won a contract for supplying servers to Xinjiang Bingtuan for 'public safety purposes', which is associated with the suppression of Uyghurs ethnic group and construction of a surveillance system in the province of Xinjiang.\n\n### Server tampering allegation\n\nOn October 4, 2018, *Bloomberg Businessweek* published a report, citing unnamed corporate and governmental sources, which claimed that the Chinese People's Liberation Army had forced Supermicro's Chinese sub-contractors to add microchips with hardware backdoors to its servers. The report claimed that the compro...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}

Content: Green computing is critical for today’s data centers, which consume one to one and a half percent of worldwide electricity demand and billions of gallons of drinking water per year. We estimate that up to ten billion dollars in energy costs can be saved if data centers lower their Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) with Supermicro technology and that an additional 30 fossil fuel power plants would not have to be built.1 As we continue to grow, we remain steadfast in our commitment to “Follow Our Nature” and continue building for the future of computing and our planet. Green Computing is not a message, a group or a project, it is in our DNA.

Content: 5000000

0
(3.1.1.24) Anticipated financial effect figure in the long-term – maximum (currency) 
5000000
(3.1.1.25) Explanation of financial effect figure
The range presented for short, medium, and long term time horizons are set the same. They represent the minimum value for the risk at 0 dollars, which is the same 
across all time horizons. As Dell did not see any impacts from this risk in FY24, this also represents the financial effect of this risk in the past fiscal year. For the 
purpose of CDP reporting, the maximum amount listed for the short, medium and long term time horizons is listed at 5,000,000, and is based on the maximum 
deductible that Dell would have to pay for damages incurred due to extreme weather events such as a hurricane or tornado. In the past this maximum deductible was 
lower, but has risen since 2020 due to a large Tornado which destroyed Dell inventory in Nashville, Tennessee. At this point in tim...

For example, tariffs on technology components imported from China can increase HPE's production costs. According to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, tariffs on electronics have risen by an average of 15% since 2020, directly affecting companies like HPE that rely on global supply chains. **Government Regulations:**In the US and Europe, stringent regulations on data privacy (e.g., GDPR) and cybersecurity require HPE to invest heavily in compliance measures. The cost of GDPR compliance alone is estimated to be around $1.7 million for large enterprises, according to a 2024 report by the International Associati...

**Washington, D.C.** – Today, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) announced a package of rules designed to further impair the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) capability to produce advanced-node semiconductors that can be used in the next generation of advanced weapon systems and in artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced computing, which have significant military applications. This action is a proactive measure enhancing the Department of Commerce’s work to impede the PRC’s ability to procure and produce the technologies necessary for its military modernization.

In addition to the license requirements for items specified on the CCL, there are additional restrictions on items listed in Supplement No. 2 to Part 744 of the EAR if you have knowledge that those items are intended, entirely or in part, for a military end user or end use. In addition, a license is required for any item subject to the EAR if you have knowledge that the items are intended, entirely or in part, for a military-intelligence end use or end user. Similarly, there are licensing requirements for any item subject to the EAR where you have knowledge that the item will be used for certain weapons of mass destruction-related end uses. These license applications generally are reviewed with a presumption of denial. See Parts 742 and 744 of the EARS for additional license review policies and end use and end user controls.

Content: Effective October 7, 2022, the United States of America implemented new export controls targeting the People's Republic of China's (PRC) ability to access and develop advanced computing and semiconductor manufacturing items. The new export controls reflect the United States' ambition to counter the accelerating advancement of China's high-tech capabilities in these spaces to address its foreign policy and national security concerns.

## Background of new export controls

### Huawei and ZTE equipment ban

In August 2018, President Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (NDAA 2019). The act prohibited the use and procurement of Huawei and ZTE equipment from being used by all U.S. federal government executive agencies, citing security concerns. In June 2020 the U.S. federal government officially designated Huawei and ZTE as threats to national security due to their close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and China's military. As for the reasoning for this classification, spoke...

Content: On December 2, 2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) adopted yet another round of amendments to the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) to curb advances by the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) in artificial intelligence (“AI”) and advanced semiconductor design and production.[1] These EAR amendments aim to impede China’s ability to develop an indigenous semiconductor manufacturing base and to prevent the PRC from applying such key technologies to significant military uses in the PRC’s modernization of its armed forces. The EAR amendments became effective immediately with a delayed compliance date of December 31, 2024, for certain of the changes. This third round of EAR changes follows and substantially expands previous EAR amendments in October 2022 and October 2023 with respect to exports to the PRC of items relating to advanced semiconductor manufacturing.

Title: PESTEL Analysis of Cisco Systems
URL: https://swotanalysisexample.com/products/cisco-pestle-analysis
Content: ## Political factors

Ongoing trade tensions, especially between the U.S. and China, have affected Cisco's supply chain. These tensions have led to higher tariff costs; for instance, in 2024, tariffs on certain components increased expenses by approximately 5%. Geopolitical instability in regions like Eastern Europe also disrupts business. Cisco reported a 3% decrease in revenue from affected markets in Q1 2024.

Governments globally are tightening cybersecurity regulations. This includes mandates like the US NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Cisco must invest in product development to meet these standards. For example, in fiscal year 2024, Cisco's security revenue was $4.8 billion. Expanding compliance teams is also crucial for Cisco.

Governments worldwide are prioritizing technology sovereignty, leading to stricter data privacy regulations. Cisco must invest heavily in global data privacy compliance. The global data privacy market is projected to reach $17.1 billion by 2024. Companies must develop new data pro...

Title: [6 Steps] Cisco PESTEL Analysis

Content: **Global Political Landscape & International Operations:**Geopolitical instability, particularly tensions between the US and China, significantly impacts Cisco. For example, the US government's restrictions on exporting certain technologies to Chinese companies directly affects Cisco's sales and supply chain. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine also disrupts supply chains and creates uncertainty in the European market. Cisco must diversify its supply chain and explore alternative markets to mitigate these risks. **Government Regulations Affecting Tech:**The tech industry faces increasing scrutiny from governments worldwide. In the US, proposed legislation on data privacy and antitrust could significantly impact Cisco's business model. The European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) impose stringent regulations on online platforms, potentially affecting Cisco's cloud services and digital solutions. Cisco needs to invest in compliance programs and adapt its strategies to adhere to thes...

Content: # Failed export of CISCO routers highlights need for due diligence

## 25 August 2023

We are warning exporters to carefully check the requirements for export licences following a rise in seizure notices being issued by Border Force for exports of high-tech CISCO goods by a small British business.

In the latest case, we were asked to advise an exporter because one of their shipments, which included routers manufactured by the international networking giant CISCO Systems, had been stopped at the UK border. The shipment was bound for a middle eastern country.

All internationally traded goods are categorised for customs and tax purposes using commodity codes; in the case of the CISCO routers, the code to which they belonged required them to be checked for “dual use controls” before export – which is why they were stopped at the border.

The term “dual use” refers to goods, whether specially manufactured or sold “off the shelf”, which, though they have been designed for commercial, non-military use, could be us...

Each year, an independent third party provides a limited assurance review of our Scope 1 and 2 GHG inventory. In fiscal 2022, we expanded the assurance review to include the Scope 3 categories we report on in the table above. This review is conducted in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14064-3 International Standard. After the review is completed, we update the emissions data in the ESG Reporting Hub and related disclosures to align with the assurance statements. Cisco's Scope 1-3 assurance statement for fiscal 2024 is available here. Assurance statements from previous fiscal years are available at the links below:

A key priority of our environmental sustainability strategy, The Plan for Possible, is to accelerate the transition to clean energy.

A key priority of our environmental sustainability strategy, The Plan for Possible, is to accelerate the transition to clean energy.

To power the world with renewables, the grid requires updated digital infrastructure to connect diverse, decentralized sources of clean energy. However, as the world electrifies, it must simultaneously reduce the amount of energy used by a connected economy.

One important piece of Cisco’s clean energy strategy is our goal to reach net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our value chain by 2040 by prioritizing reductions across all scopes of emissions. We are proud that Cisco’s 2040 net-zero goal was approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2022 under its Corporate Net-Zero Standard. Cisco was one of the first technology hardware and equipment companies to have its net-zero goal validated under...

External assurance
Each year, an independent third party provides a limited assurance review of select GHG, 
water, and waste inventories. This review is Scope 1 and 2 GHG inventory is conducted 
in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14064-3:2019 
International Standard. After the review is completed, we update the emissions data in the 
Purpose Reporting Hub and related disclosures to align with the assurance statements. The 
scope of the review includes all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission sources, Scope 3 emissions 
from some categories, including purchased goods and services, upstream transportation 
and distribution, downstream transportation and distribution, and end of life treatment of sold 
products. The GHG, water, and waste inventories apply to all owned and leased facilities under 
Cisco’s operational control.

Title: Arista Networks (ANET) Stock Drops Due to New Tariff Policies
URL: https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2762578/arista-networks-anet-stock-drops-due-to-new-tariff-policies
Content: Arista Networks (ANET, Financial) experienced a significant stock decline of 11.09% today, closing at a price of $71.27. This drop was triggered by recent news of new tariffs announced by the U.S. administration, which led to broader market sell-offs impacting the tech sector particularly hard.
Arista Networks is facing potential disruptions due to these tariffs, given its reliance on foreign-sourced manufacturing for networking hardware. The anticipated cost increases may affect its margins and overall financial performance. Despite the company's recent strong performance in sales driven by trends in artificial intelligence, these tariff challenges could pose risks to future growth.
In examining the stock's financial metrics, Arista Networks presents a PE ratio of 32.09 and a price-to-book (PB) ratio of 9, both of which signal its current valuation context. The company's market capitalization stands at $89.88 billion, indicating its substantial presence in the market. Arista Networks' financial strength is h...

This drop was triggered by recent news of new tariffs announced by the U.S. administration, which led to broader market sell-offs impacting the tech sector particularly hard.\nArista Networks is facing potential disruptions due to these tariffs, given its reliance on foreign-sourced manufacturing for networking hardware. The anticipated cost increases may affect its margins and overall financial performance. Despite the company\'s recent strong performance in sales driven by trends in artificial intelligence, these tariff challenges could pose risks to future growth.\nIn examining the stock\'s financial metrics, Arista Networks presents a PE ratio of 32.09 and a price-to-book (PB) ratio of 9, both of which signal its current valuation context. The company\'s market capitalization stands at $89.88 billion, indicating its substantial presence in the market.

Tariffs on imported components increase production costs, while restrictions on technology exports can limit market penetration in key regions. For example, the U.S. government\'s scrutiny of Chinese technology companies has created opportunities for Arista to gain market share in certain sectors but also necessitates careful navigation of export controls and compliance regulations. **Government Regulations:**The technology sector faces increasing regulatory scrutiny, particularly concerning data privacy and cybersecurity.

Abstract 
To safeguard its technological leadership, the U.S. has restricted domestic suppliers from exporting 
specific cutting-edge technologies to selected Chinese firms. Domestic firms affected by these export 
controls halt sales to Chinese customers, as intended, but struggle to establish new relations with 
alternative customers domestically or in politically aligned regions. As a result, domestic suppliers 
experience a $130 billion decline in market capitalization, along with reductions in profitability, 
employment, and bank lending. We also show how Chinese firms strategically respond to export controls. 
Overall, export controls impose significant costs on domestic firms producing the very technologies these 
policies in...

Against the backdrop of changes in tariff policies, the operation and development trends of various companies in the industry have attracted significant market attention, and their response strategies and business performance profoundly impact investors' decision-making.

The state of the Trump tariffs is still very much in the “will they, won’t they” phase, but Ciena is nonetheless prepared for a financial impact.

CFO Jim Moylan said Thursday Ciena expects the total cost of tariffs to be approximately $10 million per quarter, “assuming that the current tariff structure does not change.”

The Trump administration’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, if sustained, spell bad news for vendors with manufacturing footholds outside the U.S. Ciena has said most of the products in its supply chain come from Canada, Mexico, India and Thailand.

The $10 million estimate falls in line with fellow vendor CommScope’s tariff predictions. CommScope in May said it anticipates a $10-15 million impact primarily affecting its Ruckus business.

Content: ## Volkov Law TV
##### May 27, 2025
Enforcement risks and compliance are evolving.  The Justice Department, DHS-Customs and Border Patrol, the Bureau of Industry and Security, and OFAC are focusing on a range of issues: tariff compliance, imports, sanctions and export controls, with a new emphasis on aggressive regulatory fines and criminal prosecutions. Companies face a fresh set of tariff and import risks, along with increased prosecution of China-targeted sanctions and export controls.

For those companies tied to foreign suppliers and vendors, companies have to react nimbly while protecting themselves from government investigations and enforcement scrutiny.  At the same time, companies have to modify their third-party due diligence and engagement process to incorporate updated risk analyses.

At the same time, companies have to modify their third-party due diligence and engagement process to incorporate updated risk analyses.\n\nJoin Michael Volkov as he reviews these new and fast-changing trade risks....

Title: Broadcom's Big Outperformance Shows Strength Amid Tariff Decline
URL: https://www.entrepreneur.com/finance/broadcoms-big-outperformance-shows-strength-amid-tariff/489870
Content: This story originally appeared on MarketBeat

Amid all of the tariff-related volatility in the market, semiconductor leader Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) has fared better than many. Since Trump’s tariff announcement hit markets on Apr. 3,

**shares of Broadcom are up nearly 8%** as of the Apr. 9 close.

This performance is impressive, considering the S&P 500 Index is down nearly 3% over that period. The Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXQ) is down 2%.

[content-module:CompanyOverview|NASDAQ:AVGO]

However, Broadcom dropped over 10% on Apr. 3 in reaction to the Liberation Day announcement.

It dropped another 5% the next day as the Chinese announced reciprocal tariffs. Thus, markets clearly feel Broadcom has some tariff risk.

This comes even though Trump excluded semiconductors from his tariffs.

The analysis below will break down

**Broadcom’s tariff exposure in two ways: direct and indirect exposure.**

It will also examine why the stock has performed comparatively well.

Broadcom’s $215 price target cut isn’t just about numbers—it’s a wake-up call about the

China’s recent decision to hike retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods to **125%** (up from 84%) directly threatens Broadcom’s **20% revenue exposure** to its second-largest market. The company’s semiconductors power everything from AI servers to Apple devices, but tariffs could force cost hikes or reduced demand.

Content: # Global Tech Regulatory Risks and U.S. Retaliatory Trade Policy: Navigating Geopolitical Tail Risks in Semiconductor and Tech SectorsWritten byPhilip Carter

- Trump administration imposes 300% tariffs on semiconductor imports and restricts "Highly Protected Technology and Chips" to counter EU regulatory policies like the Digital Markets Act.

- EU retaliates with tariffs on U.S. imports, escalating tensions akin to the 2018–2019 U.S.-China trade war, threatening $8–10B in U.S. AI chip exports to Europe.

- Investors shift toward defense-oriented firms (e.g., Broadcom, Applied Materials) and export-controlled tech to hedge against systemic risks amid fragmented global tech governance.

- CHIPS Act funding and national security alignment position Intel and Qualcomm to benefit from long-term government support despite short-term trade restrictions.

Content: ##### Political

Political factors within the PESTEL analysis for Broadcom involve an in-depth examination of the impact of governmental actions, policies, and stability on the company’s operations and competitive position. To dive deeper into this analysis, it’s essential to consider various aspects:

**Government Regulations and Policies:** Broadcom operates in a highly regulated industry, subject to various laws and regulations concerning technology, intellectual property, and trade. Changes in these regulations, such as stricter export controls or data privacy laws, can directly affect Broadcom’s ability to develop, manufacture, and sell its products globally. Broadcom can mitigate regulatory risks by proactively monitoring legislative developments and engaging policymakers to advocate for policies supporting innovation and free trade. Investing in compliance programs and ensuring adherence to all relevant regulations can help mitigate legal risks.

URL: https://stockstory.org/us/stocks/nasdaq/avgo/news/why-up-down/why-broadcom-avgo-shares-are-getting-obliterated-today-2
Content: ## What Happened?

Shares of fabless chip and software maker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) fell 9.2% in the afternoon session after President Trump announced "reciprocal tariffs" on all US imports, set at a minimum rate of 10%.

From clothing brands and electronics makers to the e-commerce sites that move their goods, companies built on global supply chains took the biggest hit. Stocks with heavy exposure to Asia were especially hard-hit, as the new tariffs threatened the growth and profits of firms with factories in the region. Vietnam, central to many companies' production plans, faced a 46% tariff. Cambodia and Indonesia were also in the crosshairs, with tariff rates of 49% and 32%. These measures could significantly erode the competitiveness of goods produced in those regions. For example, reduced production volumes would negatively affect the sales growth of all companies benefiting from these manufacturing hubs.

The shares closed the day at $154.07, down 10.4% from previous close.

Title: PESTLE Analysis of Broadcom Limited
URL: https://canvasbusinessmodel.com/products/broadcom-limited-pestle-analysis
Content: ## Political factors

Broadcom faces strict tech regulations, especially regarding exports and IP. Updated export controls in 2024/2025 could restrict its global reach. Data privacy laws, like GDPR, also impact its operations, potentially raising compliance costs by 10-15%. Changes in government policies can directly affect Broadcom's profitability and market access.

Broadcom faces risks from trade policies and tariffs, especially given its global operations. The U.S.-China trade tensions continue to be a major factor. In 2024, tariffs potentially affected Broadcom's supply chain costs and market access. For example, in 2024, approximately 30% of Broadcom's revenue comes from China.

Broadcom navigates geopolitical risks, particularly in regions vital for chip manufacturing. Political stability directly impacts Broadcom's operations, with instability potentially disrupting supply chains. Investor sentiment is sensitive to geopolitical events; for example, in 2024, geopolitical concerns influenced tech stock ...

To dive deeper into this analysis, it’s essential to consider various aspects:\n\n**Government Regulations and Policies:** Broadcom operates in a highly regulated industry, subject to various laws and regulations concerning technology, intellectual property, and trade. Changes in these regulations, such as stricter export controls or data privacy laws, can directly affect Broadcom’s ability to develop, manufacture, and sell its products globally. Broadcom can mitigate regulatory risks by proactively monitoring legislative developments and engaging policymakers to advocate for policies supporting innovation and free trade. Investing in compliance programs and ensuring adherence to all relevant regulations can help mitigate legal risks.\n\n**Trade Policies and Tariffs:** Broadcom’s global supply...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 5:\nTitle: Why Broadcom (AVGO) Shares Are Getting Obliterated ...\nURL: https://stockstory.org/us/stocks/nasdaq/avgo/news/why-up-down/why-broadcom-avgo-shares-are-getting-obliterated-today-2\nContent: ## What Happened?\n\nShares of fabless chip and software maker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) fell 9.2% in the afternoon session after President Trump announced "reciprocal tariffs" on all US imports, set at a minimum rate of 10%.\n\nFrom clothing brands and electronics makers to the e-commerce sites that move their goods, companies built on global supply chains took the biggest hit. Stocks with heavy exposure to Asia were especially hard-hit, as the new tariffs threatened the growth and profits of firms with factories in the region. Vietnam, central to many companies\' production plans, faced a 46% tariff. Cambodia and Indonesia were also in the crosshairs, with tariff rates of 49% and 32%. These measures could significantly erode the competitiveness of goods produced in those regions. For example, reduced production volumes would negatively affect the sales growth of all companies benefiting from these manufacturing hubs.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $154.07, down 10.4% from previous close.\n\nThe stock market overreacts...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 6:\nTitle: PESTLE Analysis of Broadcom Limited\nURL: https://canvasbusinessmodel.com/products/broadcom-limited-pestle-analysis\nContent: ## Political factors\n\nBroadcom faces strict tech regulations, especially regarding exports and IP. Updated export controls in 2024/2025 could restrict its global reach. Data privacy laws, like GDPR, also impact its operations, potentially raising compliance costs by 10-15%. Changes in government policies can directly affect Broadcom\'s profitability and market access.\n\nBroadcom faces risks from trade policies and tariffs, especially given its global operations. The U.S.-China trade tensions continue to be a major factor. In 2024, tariffs potentially affected Broadcom\'s supply chain costs and market access. For example, in 2024, approximately 30% of Broadcom\'s revenue comes from China.\n\nBroadcom navigates geopolitical risks, particularly in regions vital for chip manufacturing. Political stability directly impacts Broadcom\'s operations, with instability potentially disrupting supply chains.

**BIS Expands The Scope of the Foreign Direct Product Rule Concerning Iran**

July 24, 2024: The Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) implemented an expansion of controls on the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of certain foreign-produced items located in or destined to Iran, to address ongoing concerns regarding Iran’s potential use of U.S. technology in weapons systems.

This rule implements the requirements of the No Technology for Terror Act (the Act), which was passed in April as part of emergency supplemental appropriations for the current fiscal year. As required by the Act, the BIS rule expands the scope of the Export Administration Regulations’ (EAR) Iran Foreign Direct Product rule (FDPR). The expansion, effective July 23, 2024, is designed to further impede Iran’s ability to procure technology and components critical for military systems, including advanced drones that pose threats to U.S. forces and allies.

**Fortinet Inc **(NASDAQ:FTNT) could be the most exposed security hardware vendor to newly announced U.S. tariffs, with a potential 60-basis-point margin headwind due to its reliance on Taiwan-based manufacturing.

JPMorgan analyst

**Brian Essex** warns that this exposure could significantly impact the company's margins.

## Fortinet's Taiwan Exposure Creates Headwinds

According to Essex, Fortinet manufactures approximately 95% of its hardware in Taiwan, making it highly susceptible to tariffs imposed on the region. His calculations suggest that the company could face incremental tariff costs of roughly $40 million, translating to a 60bps impact on margins.

While Fortinet could mitigate some of this impact by raising prices or shifting manufacturing to othe...

Content: ## Volkov Law TV
##### May 27, 2025
Enforcement risks and compliance are evolving.  The Justice Department, DHS-Customs and Border Patrol, the Bureau of Industry and Security, and OFAC are focusing on a range of issues: tariff compliance, imports, sanctions and export controls, with a new emphasis on aggressive regulatory fines and criminal prosecutions. Companies face a fresh set of tariff and import risks, along with increased prosecution of China-targeted sanctions and export controls.

For those companies tied to foreign suppliers and vendors, companies have to react nimbly while protecting themselves from government investigations and enforcement scrutiny.  At the same time, companies have to modify their third-party due diligence and engagement process to incorporate updated risk analyses.

### Conflict Minerals

As defined by US legislation, “conflict minerals” include tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, which are the derivatives of the minerals cassiterite, columbite-tantalite and wolframite, respectively. The derivatives of these minerals are referred to as 3TG. These minerals are commonly used in electronics products. Some of the mining operations for these minerals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries are controlled by warring militias who may be financing armed conflict with profits from the sale of these minerals. This ongoing conflict has been linked to human rights violations, labor abuses, and environmental degradation.

Abstract 
To safeguard its technological leadership, the U.S. has restricted domestic suppliers from exporting 
specific cutting-edge technologies to selected Chinese firms. Domestic firms affected by these export 
controls halt sales to Chinese customers, as intended, but struggle to establish new relations with 
alternative customers domestically or in politically aligned regions. As a result, domestic suppliers 
experience a $130 billion decline in market capitalization, along with reductions in profitability, 
employment, and bank lending. We also show how Chinese firms strategically respond to export controls. 
Overall, export controls impose significant costs on domestic firms producing the very technologies these 
policies in...

Content: ## The current tariff framework

In early April, the United States updated import tariffs for end products from approximately 90 countries before announcing a 90-day pause for implementation. A 10 percent tariff on goods from these countries remains in place during this period. China was the lone exception (Exhibit 2). Further, in March, the United States used its authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to raise steel and aluminum tariffs to 25 percent (up from 10 percent) for all nations, which could affect companies pursuing major construction projects. In response to tariffs placed on Chinese exports to the United States, the China Semiconductor Industry Association (CSIA) issued a notice stating the country of origin for integrated circuits will be determined by the location of the wafer fabrication plant (or the country where the “last substantial transformation” occurred).

Content: ### Available Downloads

An initial assessment of recent attempts by the United States to limit or delay China’s ability to acquire and produce advanced semiconductor technologies reveals a mixed picture in a complex and rapidly evolving industry. On the one hand, new chip restrictions have significantly affected China’s semiconductor ecosystem, limiting access to equipment essential for next-generation production. On the other hand, China is intensifying its domestic investments in more advanced chips while also reducing market shares of U.S. firms—and by extension, the revenues U.S. firms need to invest in the next-generation of technology. Over time, this loss of market share could well undermine the competitiveness of U.S. firms in this key industry. The initial volley of restrictions has also revealed limitations of export controls, both because the technology is rapidly changing and because there are gaps in compliance between U.S. companies and those of allies.

One key conclusion, however, is that the...

On the one hand, new chip restrictions have significantly affected China’s semiconductor ecosystem, limiting access to equipment essential for next-generation production. On the other hand, China is intensifying its domestic investments in more advanced chips while also reducing market shares of U.S. firms—and by extension, the revenues U.S. firms need to invest in the next-generation of technology. Over time, this loss of market share could well undermine the competitiveness of U.S. firms in this key industry. The initial volley of restrictions has also revealed limitations of export controls, both because the technology is rapidly changing and because there are gaps in compliance between U.S. companies and those of allies.\n\nOne key conclusion, however, is that the...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'}

Content: ## The current tariff framework

In early April, the United States updated import tariffs for end products from approximately 90 countries before announcing a 90-day pause for implementation. A 10 percent tariff on goods from these countries remains in place during this period. China was the lone exception (Exhibit 2). Further, in March, the United States used its authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to raise steel and aluminum tariffs to 25 percent (up from 10 percent) for all nations, which could affect companies pursuing major construction projects. In response to tariffs placed on Chinese exports to the United States, the China Semiconductor Industry Association (CSIA) issued a notice stating the country of origin for integrated circuits will be determined by the location of the wafer fabrication plant (or the country where the “last substantial transformation” occurred).

Content: The U.S. government and those of its allies have imposed and progressively tightened controls on the export of semiconductor technology, devices, and tools to China in an effort to maintain U.S. leadership in this critical sector. China has responded with an all-out effort to stimulate domestic chip innovation capabilities and eliminate dependency on foreign sources. The outcome of the chip innovation race will determine which country leads in the development and application of AI, with major strategic and economic security implications.

Preventing China from acquiring the most advanced chip technology makes sense from a national security perspective, but export restrictions alone cannot substitute for comprehensive industrial and research policy measures necessary to ensure U.S. leadership in semiconductor design, production, and infrastructure. Moreover, the imposition of export controls has resulted in China doubling down on its existing deeply subsidized development efforts that could well produce breakt...

## TL;DR

**Background**: The United States implemented unprecedented restrictions on semiconductor exports to China in October 2022, which were subsequently expanded in 2023 and 2024.

Aimed at limiting China’s AI capabilities, the controls serve to restrict the export of advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) and semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and even prohibit U.S. persons from supporting advanced Chinese chip facilities.

**But… **The effectiveness of these controls hinges on several critical timeline questions. Most importantly, should policymakers expect that transformative AI capabilities will emerge within two-to-three years, or will such developments take a decade or more?

If development is slower, China may achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency in the interim. This would render the controls counterproductive by accelerating China’s technological independence, while simultaneously harming U.S. companies and potentially exacerbating the geopo...

Content: ## Executive Summary

Since October 2022, the United States has devoted significant resources to restricting China’s access to artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced semiconductor technologies. In the final months of the Biden administration, the Department of Commerce issued four additional far-reaching export control updates. On December 2, 2024, it released two rules that added 140 companies to the Entity List, expanded the scope of the Foreign Direct Product Rule (FDPR), and restricted new technology areas such as high-bandwidth memory, among other measures. In the second week of January 2025, the Department of Commerce issued the AI Diffusion Framework and the Foundry Due Diligence Rule, further shaping the spread of AI and semiconductor technologies throughout the world. Export controls remain front and center for the second Trump administration, which directed an effort to “identify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls—especially those that enable the transfer of strategic goods, soft...

**Introduction **

The United States currently stands at a critical strategic crossroads regarding its policy on advanced semiconductor exports to China, particularly those used for artificial-intelligence (AI) systems. The Biden administration implemented unprecedented restrictions on chip exports and semiconductor manufacturing equipment in October 2022,

[1] which were subsequently expanded and refined in October 2023 [2] and December 2024. [3] These decisions have significantly shaped the technological landscape and set the stage for what may become a defining issue for the new Trump administration.

At the heart of this policy debate is a fundamental question about timelines and predictions: how quickly will transformative AI capabilities develop, and what will China’s indigenous semiconductor capacity look like when they do? The answer to these questions profoundly affect whether current export-control policies will achieve their stra...

## TL;DR

**Background**: The United States implemented unprecedented restrictions on semiconductor exports to China in October 2022, which were subsequently expanded in 2023 and 2024.

Aimed at limiting China’s AI capabilities, the controls serve to restrict the export of advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) and semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and even prohibit U.S. persons from supporting advanced Chinese chip facilities.

**But… **The effectiveness of these controls hinges on several critical timeline questions. Most importantly, should policymakers expect that transformative AI capabilities will emerge within two-to-three years, or will such developments take a decade or more?

If development is slower, China may achieve semiconductor self-sufficiency in the interim. This would render the controls counterproductive by accelerating China’s technological independence, while simultaneously harming U.S. companies and potentially exacerbating the geopo...

Content: Further, the export controls may deter the formation of relationships between U.S. firms and firms in countries other than China for the same reasons. Rather than rely on U.S. firms over the long term, these third-party firms may prefer to identify sources of supply that are less likely to burden them with future restrictions. The New York Fed’s report indicated this may be the case, as it found that affected U.S. firms were not establishing new relationships with firms located in allied nations either.

The potential lost revenue could have a considerable impact on the U.S. semiconductor industry, as it undermines the economies of scale that the industry depends on. Given the huge up-front costs in semiconductor manufacturing—U.S. semiconductor firms spent nearly $50 billion on capital in 2022 alone—firms must maximize their sales to recoup their investment and remain price competitive.

**Washington, D.C.** – Today, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) announced a package of rules designed to further impair the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) capability to produce advanced-node semiconductors that can be used in the next generation of advanced weapon systems and in artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced computing, which have significant military applications. This action is a proactive measure enhancing the Department of Commerce’s work to impede the PRC’s ability to procure and produce the technologies necessary for its military modernization.

Content: The U.S. government and those of its allies have imposed and progressively tightened controls on the export of semiconductor technology, devices, and tools to China in an effort to maintain U.S. leadership in this critical sector. China has responded with an all-out effort to stimulate domestic chip innovation capabilities and eliminate dependency on foreign sources. The outcome of the chip innovation race will determine which country leads in the development and application of AI, with major strategic and economic security implications.

Preventing China from acquiring the most advanced chip technology makes sense from a national security perspective, but export restrictions alone cannot substitute for comprehensive industrial and research policy measures necessary to ensure U.S. leadership in semiconductor design, production, and infrastructure. Moreover, the imposition of export controls has resulted in China doubling down on its existing deeply subsidized development efforts that could well produce breakt...

Content: # US Export Controls on AI and Semiconductors: Two Divergent Visions

**Introduction **

The United States currently stands at a critical strategic crossroads regarding its policy on advanced semiconductor exports to China, particularly those used for artificial-intelligence (AI) systems. The Biden administration implemented unprecedented restrictions on chip exports and semiconductor manufacturing equipment in October 2022,

[1] which were subsequently expanded and refined in October 2023 [2] and December 2024. [3] These decisions have significantly shaped the technological landscape and set the stage for what may become a defining issue for the new Trump administration.

At the heart of this policy debate is a fundamental question about timelines and predictions: how quickly will transformative AI capabilities develop, and what will China’s indigenous semiconductor capacity look like when they do? The answer to these questions profoundly affect whether current export-control policies will achieve their stra...

Content: ### What’s in a name? CSRHub, CSR HUB, ESGHub

We considered many names for our site—in fact we spent our first year and a half under a different name—EkoHub. We liked “Eko” — coming from the Greek word Oikos, related to economy, ecology, and “home” or social concerns. From the beginning, we believed the word “Hub” reflected our desire to be at the center of the sustainability area, providing knowledge, harmony, and consensus among the hundreds of experts judging the ESG performance of companies.

URL: https://koalagains.com/industry-tariff-report/semiconductors/evaluate-industry-areas/2-1
Content: Tariff Impact: The new tariff landscape presents a mixed but largely manageable impact for Analog Devices. The exemption of semiconductors from tariffs on goods from Taiwan and Malaysia is highly beneficial, safeguarding ADI's critical manufacturing partnerships with foundries like TSMC and its major assembly/test operations in Malaysia from cost hikes (insightplus.bakermckenzie.com). This provides a significant advantage. However, the 50% tariff on Chinese imports (whitecase.com) and new tariffs on South Korean (

`25%`) and Japanese (

`15%`) goods introduce risks. These could increase the cost of sourced materials and indirectly dampen end-market demand, particularly for customers whose supply chains are more exposed. Overall, while ADI faces new cost pressures, the key exemptions mitigate the most severe direct threats to its core production pipeline.

Content: ## When Trade Meets Technology

Geopolitics has long shaped the semiconductor supply chain, but recent developments have sharply escalated its influence. China’s Ministry of Commerce has launched anti-dumping investigations into U.S. analog chips, targeting Broadcom, Texas Instruments, onsemi, and Analog Devices. The outcome could be far more than a bureaucratic process—it may lead to new tariffs, shipment delays, and heightened cost volatility for OEMs and contract manufacturers.

These investigations are the latest tremor in a broader fault line stretching across trade policy, distribution strategy, and procurement planning. For OEMs, procurement managers, and supply chain leaders, the challenge lies not only in recognizing these risks but also in understanding how quickly they can cascade across product lines and customer commitments.

Bernstein estimates the US has 18% of global analog semiconductor capacity, enough to meet domestic demand, and only 4% of global discrete capacity. US-based suppliers such as Texas Instruments and Analog Devices are well-positioned to meet domestic needs, while non-US suppliers like Infineon and Renesas face exposure risks due to their limited US production footprint. However, Bernstein concludes that the impact of tariffs should be manageable for both US and non-US suppliers.Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TI) are well-positioned to meet domestic semiconductor needs in the United States, according to recent reports.

Title: The effects of tariffs on the semiconductor industry
URL: https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/the-effects-of-tariffs-on-the-semiconductor-industry
Content: ## The current tariff framework

In early April, the United States updated import tariffs for end products from approximately 90 countries before announcing a 90-day pause for implementation. A 10 percent tariff on goods from these countries remains in place during this period. China was the lone exception (Exhibit 2). Further, in March, the United States used its authority under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to raise steel and aluminum tariffs to 25 percent (up from 10 percent) for all nations, which could affect companies pursuing major construction projects. In response to tariffs placed on Chinese exports to the United States, the China Semiconductor Industry Association (CSIA) issued a notice stating the country of origin for integrated circuits will be determined by the location of the wafer fabrication plant (or the country where the “last substantial transformation” occurred).

Content: # Texas Instruments Rises on Strong Earnings, but Tariff Risks Loom LargeWritten byNathaniel Stone

Texas Instruments (TI) (NASDAQ: TXN) saw its stock surge following a robust first-quarter 2025 earnings report, but lingering tariff-related risks and geopolitical tensions with China cast a shadow over its long-term outlook. Let’s dissect the numbers, risks, and investor implications.

**Q1 2025 Results: Strength in Analog Chips, but Margins Under Pressure**

TI reported

**$4.07 billion in revenue**, a 11% year-over-year (YoY) increase, driven by strong demand in industrial and automotive markets. Its analog segment, which accounts for 80% of sales, grew 13% YoY to $3.21 billion, fueled by 5G infrastructure and electric vehicle adoption.

However, operating profit grew just 3% YoY, highlighting margin pressures. Net income rose 7% to $1.18 billion, while EPS hit $1.28, exceeding estimates. Cash flow remained a bright spot: trailing 12-month free cash flow reached

Content: # Navigating the Tariff Storm: Texas Instruments' Strategic Resilience in a Shifting Semiconductor LandscapeWritten bySamuel Reed

- Semiconductor industry faces 2025 perfect storm of tariffs, supply chain bottlenecks, and geopolitical tensions, with overlapping duties inflating production costs by 10-14%.

- Texas Instruments (TI) outperforms peers via supply chain flexibility, inventory discipline, and capital allocation rigor, achieving 16% YoY revenue growth vs. Intel's 50% decline.

- TI's diversified analog/embedded portfolio and Mexico-based manufacturing buffer it against trade risks, contrasting with AMD's AI/data center exposure and Intel's supply chain vulnerabilities.

- The sector's re-rating favors companies with low tariff-exposure and strong balance sheets; TI's $5B capex and BASIC Act tailwinds position it as a defensive semiconductor investment.

Content: TI’s Trade Compliance and the Global Trade in Chips 
 
NGO and media reports have noted that bad actors continue to find ways to obtain and 
divert semiconductors into Russia. TI strongly opposes its chips’ use in Russian military 
equipment and (as explained below) invests significant resources on its own and with the 
industry and U.S. government to prevent bad actors from obtaining TI’s chips. 
Even advanced weapons systems require ordinary chips to perform basic functions like 
managing power and sensing and transmitting data. Ordinary chips can perform the same basic 
functions in household items like toys and appliances. To keep the Company’s products out of 
the hands of bad actors – and to comply with U.S. and other government export controls and 
sanctions – the Company has a long-standing, robust Global Trade Compliance (“GTC”) 
program that touches every aspect of the Company’s operations. The GTC team screens

Content: Lately, all eyes have been on U.S. trade policy. In recent months, the threats and implementations of tariffs on products from Canada, Mexico and virtually every other country — introduced by the Trump administration — have raised concerns across multiple industries.

While not all tariffs are inherently disruptive, some sectors may be hit harder than others. In the case of semiconductors, investors and the broader public place significant attention on tariffs affecting imports from China, Taiwan and other East Asian manufacturing hubs. However, policies targeting Mexican products could trigger underappreciated reactions across the semiconductor supply chain.

### Why Mexico Matters

Historically, much of the focus on semiconductors has centered on products originating in East Asia, with particular attention to early- and late-stage supply-chain dynamics. However, in today’s global landscape, tracking only the end-market or East Asian operations no longer provides a complete picture of industry activity.

Synopsys Inc., a top maker of chip-design software, suspended its financial guidance for the current quarter and fiscal year after receiving word from the US government about new restrictions on exports to China.
The company said it got a letter from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security informing it of the new curbs on Thursday. 'Synopsys is currently assessing the potential impact of the BIS Letter on its business, operating results and financial condition,' the company said in a statement.

Content: It appears the Trump administration has imposed new export controls on chip design software as it seeks to further undermine China’s ability to make and use advanced AI chips.

Siemens EDA, Cadence Design Systems, and Synopsys all confirmed that they have received notices from the U.S. Commerce Department about new export controls on electronic automation design (EDA) software to China.

EDA tools are primarily used to aid with the design and validation of semiconductor manufacturing and testing, as well as for monitoring performance and quality. They are used by chip foundries, chipmakers, networking hardware companies, the automotive industry, and many more.

Siemens EDA, a division of German tech conglomerate Siemens, told TechCrunch that it has received a notice from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) last week about new export controls on EDA software to China and Chinese military end users.

URL: https://visiblealpha.com/data-snapshot/synopsys-to-see-china-revenue-drop-16-yoy-amid-us-export-curbs/
Content: Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS) is feeling the impact of tightened US export controls, which have placed fresh constraints on US semiconductor design software firms selling to Chinese customers. New rules now require providers to obtain export licenses for all sales to Chinese entities, extending beyond advanced chips to a broader swathe of technologies — a move that is curbing the company’s reach in its second-largest market.

In its latest quarterly results, the semiconductor design software reported a -29% year-on-year decline in revenue from China. Analysts expect the pressure to continue, with Visible Alpha consensus pointing to a -16% drop for the full fiscal year, bringing sales from China down to $830 million in 2025. The downturn comes amid reports that Synopsys may suspend services and stop accepting new orders in China while awaiting further clarification on the evolving restrictions.

Still, Synopsys is expected to deliver strong overall growth, with full-year revenue projected to rise +10.5% to $6.8 mill...

- U.S. export controls on EDA tools to China forced Synopsys to halt sales, causing 9.6% stock drop and revenue uncertainty.

- China's push for self-sufficiency accelerated domestic EDA firms like Empyrean, though advanced-node capabilities remain limited.

- Synopsys countered with Ansys acquisition and AI-driven design tools, boosting Q3 2025 revenue by 14% despite geopolitical risks.

- Investors face a dilemma: short-term China exposure risks versus long-term growth in AI/5G-driven EDA market expansion.

- Synopsys' Q3 2025 revenue rose 14% to $1.74B, but IP segment declined 8% due to U.S. export restrictions and customer issues.

- Earnings miss triggered a 5% stock drop, with analysts citing geopolitical risks and concentration in volatile markets.

Title: Test companies talk tariffs, Part 2: Keysight and Teradyne
URL: https://www.rcrwireless.com/20250529/business/tariffs-keysight-teradyne
Content: ## How do major test companies expect tariffs to impact their businesses?

Amid tariff whiplash from the Trump administration and increased geopolitical and economic tensions, companies in the test equipment and services space are navigating new market uncertainties. During the recent round of first quarter calls, some of analysts’ most frequent questions revolved around what impacts test companies were seeing from tariffs, and how they were dealing with them.

A few common themes: Companies are increasing their prices due to tariffs and expect to also see increased costs on their supplies. They are shifting sourcing and using other strategies to mitigate their exposure to tariffs and the associated costs. Several companies also mentioned eating initial tariff costs for orders which had already been placed, before they put price hikes in place.

Most executives said that they haven’t seen changes in their customer behavior yet, but are wary and watchful—and in many cases, being conservative about their expect...

Equipment from China in 2023
Teradyne, a Massachusetts-based supplier of semiconductor

manufacturing equipment out of China in 2023 following export
controls on advanced computing materials and semiconductors
issued by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in 2022 and
2023. Though of greater magnitude than others, this move

Content: # Teradyne pulled $1 billion worth of manufacturing from China amid US export controls

Published on 29/01/2024 at 22:36Share

(Reuters) - Teradyne, a supplier of semiconductor testing equipment, pulled manufacturing worth about $1 billion out of China last year, a Teradyne spokesperson said on Monday, after U.S. export regulations led to supply chain disruptions.

A factory in Suzhou was the company's main manufacturing site for its semiconductor test equipment, which it subcontracted to Flextronics.

Massachusetts-based Teradyne moved its production out after U.S. rules issued in October 2022 restricted exports to semiconductor manufacturing facilities there as part of an effort to keep U.S. technology from helping China's military.

Many U.S. companies have been trying to reduce their reliance on China in recent years as the U.S.-China tech battle ramps up and regulators limit trade in sensitive technologies like chip making.

Content: Amid tariff whiplash from the Trump administration and increased geopolitical and economic tensions, companies in the test equipment and services space are navigating new market uncertainties. During the recent round of first quarter calls, some of analysts’ most frequent questions revolved around what impacts test companies were seeing from tariffs, and how they were dealing with them.

They are shifting sourcing, and using other strategies to mitigate their exposure to tariffs and the associated costs.

*Industrial and defense technology firm expects some impact from market uncertainty and will take action to protect margins.*

Teledyne Technologies, the industrial technology company that owns a number of imaging subsidiaries and recently acquired optical component maker Qioptiq, should be relatively unaffected by imposition of US import tariffs.

Revealing the California-headquartered firm’s latest quarterly financial results, long-time CEO Robert Mehrabian said that although Teledyne was not immune to the still-unfolding situation, the structure of the business means that the vast majority of its operations will avoid new and higher tariffs.

However, he also noted that the wider market uncertainty created by the US administration's on-off deliberations would likely have some negative impact on Teledyne’s 2025 sales, telling an investor call:

“We must assume that the market uncertainty will have some impact. While this is nearly impossible to quantify, we've assumed a negative sales impact of...

A Message From Our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

In 2021, we compiled the first global inventory of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (starting with fiscal year 2020) and are developing a GHG monitoring and management plan. We have set a goal to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 combined emissions in company operations, normalized for revenue, by 40% from 2020 levels by the end of fiscal year 2040.

I should emphasize that sustainability has been a core part of Teledyne’s corporate strategy and capital allocation for over two decades. Today, Teledyne is a global leader in space-based sensing for earth science and carbon monitoring, ambient air quality monitoring, instrumentation for ocean science and climatology, and world-class products for sustainability, energy efficiency and human health.

We considered many names for our site—in fact we spent our first year and a half under a different name—EkoHub. We liked “Eko” — coming from the Greek word Oikos, related to economy, ecology, and “home” or social concerns. From the beginning, we believed the word “Hub” reflected our desire to be at the center of the sustainability area, providing knowledge, harmony, and consensus among the hundreds of experts judging the ESG performance of companies.

We have set a goal to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 combined emissions in company operations, normalized for revenue, by 40% from 2020 levels by the end of fiscal year 2040.\n\nI should emphasize that sustainability has been a core part of Teledyne’s corporate strategy and capital allocation for over two decades. Today, Teledyne is a global leader in space-based sensing for earth science and carbon monitoring, ambient air quality monitoring, instrumentation for ocean science and climatology, and world-class products for sustainability, energy efficiency and human health.\n\nRecently, the prominence and importance of sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) initiat...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 3:\nTitle: ESG ratings information for Teledyne Technologies Inc.\nURL: https://www.csrhub.com/CSR_and_sustainability_information/Teledyne-Technologies-Inc\nContent: ### What’s in a name? CSRHub, CSR HUB, ESGHub\n\nWe considered many names for our site—in fact we spent our first year and a half under a different name—EkoHub. We liked “Eko” — coming from the Greek word Oikos, related to economy, ecology, and “home” or social concerns. From the beginning, we believed the word “Hub” reflected our desire to be at the center of the sustainability area, providing knowledge, harmony, and consensus among the hundreds of experts judging the ESG performance of companies.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 4:\nTitle: [PDF] 2024 Teledyne Technologies Annual Report\nURL: https://www.teledyne.com/en-us/investors/Documents/2024%20Teledyne%20Annual%20Report.pdf\nContent: 4\nTELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED  |  2024 ANNUAL REPORT\n2024\nwas a record year for Teledyne:\nfull-year sales, cash flow and non-\nGAAP earnings per share and operating margin\nwere all-time records. Furthermore, orders \nexceeded sales for five consecutive quarters, and \nwe ended the year with record backlog.\nWhile most of our shorter-cycle commercial \nbusinesses improved throughout 2024, year-over-\nyear comparisons remained difficult through \nmuch of 2024. Nevertheless, given the standout\nperformance of our marine instrumentation and \ninfrared imaging businesses, Teledyne returned \nto year-over-year growth in the second half and \nwe were able to achieve record full year sales.\nOur marine instrumentation business delivered\nsales growth of 19.2% and benefited from an\nongoing recovery in offshore energy markets \ncoupled with very strong subsea defense-related\nsales. Due in part to concerns regarding critical\nundersea infrastructure, we achieved record\nsales of autonomous underwater vehicles and\nsubsea pipe and...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 5:\nTitle: Teledyne Technologies Sustainability Report | DitchCarbon\nURL: https://ditchcarbon.com/organizations/teledyne-technologies\nContent: How does Teledyne Technologies's carbon action stack up?
