Nvidia has a few mystery customers that are making up a massive chunk of its revenue base, according to new disclosures.

In its 10-Q filing made with the SEC earlier this week, Nvidia said a single direct customer represented 13% of its total revenue in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2025, while a second direct customer made up 11% of its total revenue.

On top of that, the AI-chip maker said it had two indirect customers that each represented 10% or more of its total revenue in the first quarter.

The concentration in revenue coming from just a handful of companies comes as mega-cap tech companies rush to stock up on Nvidia's H100 AI chips to build up their generative AI capabilities.

Microchip designer Nvidia more than doubled its second-quarter revenue thanks to just a handful of whales that accounted for nearly one out of every two dollars in sales the company booked.

Four customers, whose identities were kept anonymous for competitive reasons, directly purchased goods and services collectively worth 46% of Nvidia’s $30 billion in turnover. That amounts to roughly $13.8 billion, according to the company’s 10-Q regulatory filing published alongside its hotly anticipated quarterly investor update.

Each was responsible for more than a tenth of overall top line, and their purchases were all related to its booming business selling chips to data centers, the likes of which entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk are in a rush to build amid the gold rush in artificial intelligence.

Content: Semiconductor research platform TechInsights released the final 2023 ranking of the top 25 semiconductor suppliers based on sales revenues, which showed that no new suppliers broke into the top 25 list in 2023. Still, there were significant changes in where companies were ranked.

The top-25 ranking has 13 suppliers headquartered in the United States; 3 each based in Europe, Japan, and Taiwan; 2 in South Korea; and 1 in China. It is worth noting that the top 25 list includes foundries since it is intended to compare annual sales volumes of the largest semiconductor companies and is not intended as a market share ranking.

It took about US$5.9 billion in sales for a company to make it into the top 25 supplier list in 2023.

Content: FPGA Field Programmable Gate Array PCBA Printed Circuit Board Assembly WLP Wafer Level Package... Advanced Packaging is emerging as the main pillar of the semiconductor industry, addressing the industry's shift from node scaling to functional diversification. By enhancing performance, functionality, and cost-effectiveness, AP is enabling the adoption of chiplet configurations and heterogeneous integration by leading players like TSMC, Intel, and Samsung. The chiplet approach, a cornerstone of heterogeneous integration, disaggregates complex system-on-chip (SoC) designs into multiple dies, each optimized for specific functions. This not only improves yield and lowers costs but also enables selective scaling of dies using advanced nodes, thereby maximizing performance and efficiency. Concurrently, hybrid bonding is gaining traction as a high-potential interconnect technology, facilitating metal-to-metal and oxide-to-oxide stacking with sub-10µm bump pitch. HB is already revolutionizing image sensors and 3D NAND...

As a result, the United States will reverse a decades- long downward trajectory and raise its share of global aggregate fab capacity from 10% today to 14% in 2032. In the absence of action, the US share would have slipped further to 8% by 2032. New markets and innovative technology can support resilience in assembly, test, and packaging (ATP). In ATP, Mainland China and Taiwan will continue to hold the largest share of global capacity. But with support from governments and foreign investors, we expect countries in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe to expand ATP activity.

Content: TSMC's advanced packaging CoWoS capacity continues to have strong demand. Even after doubling its capacity in 2024 and collaborating with OSAT companies, it can still not fully meet customer demands.

TSMC actively cooperates with the leading Taiwanese IC packaging and testing company, ASE Holding. ASE is capable of executing a complete 2.5D CoWoS packaging and testing. With AI applications going strong, advanced packaging technology is undoubtedly the mainstream process for future AI chips. The hope is that this can bring about a new wave of growth momentum.

TSMC executives previously stated that due to the explosive increase in customer demand for CoWoS, the overflow of orders is being shared by packaging and testing subcontractors such as Amkor and ASE, which have initiated expansion projects for oS segments or some CoW segments. In the long run, the operational momentum of the related supply chains is expected to be considerable.

Content: ## TSMC has too much capacity when China has made no secret of its desire for Taiwan

AMD is considering broadening chip production suppliers as it believes it is too reliant on semiconductor giant TSMC and this places the supply chain at risk of disruption.

The latest 4th generation Epyc processor from AMD is manufactured using TSMC's 5nm production node technology. However, while previous generations used an I/O die produced by GlobalFoundries, the latest CPU also has its I/O die manufactured by TSMC.

During a visit to Tokyo late last week, AMD CEO Lisa Su told Nikkei Asia that her company would consider "other manufacturing capabilities" besides TSMC to produce its chips to ensure it has a more resilient supply chain. As a so-called "fabless" chip company, AMD relies on others to manufacture its products.

Title: AMD posts record revenue but disappoints with data center segment results
URL: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/amd-posts-record-revenue-but-disappoints-with-data-center-segment-results/
Content: AMD’s data center revenue for Q4 2024 missed analysts' expectations, despite being up 69 percent year-on-year (YoY).

Revenue for the segment totaled $3.86 billion for the quarter, a fractional increase on the $3.5bn AMD reported in data center revenue for Q3 2024 and well below analyst’s predictions of $4.14bn.

AMD’s total FY2024 data center revenue increased 94 percent to $12.6bn, of which $5bn was from the sale of its Instinct AI GPUs. As with the previous quarter, the company said the segment growth was primarily driven by growing demand for Instinct and AMD Epyc CPUs.

Overall, AMD posted record fourth-quarter and full-year revenue, with the figures totaling $7.7bn for Q4 and $25.8bn for the full financial year. The company said it expects revenue of $7.1bn in Q1 2025, plus or minus $300 million.

Speaking during an earnings call after the results had been posted, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su said its data center segment contributed roughly 50 percent of the company’s annual revenue, as “Instinct and Epyc proces...

Content: Opinion: AMD is close to surpassing Intel in x86, but Arm thinks it can take the lead over x86.

**Fig. 1: Created by ChatGPT from a text prompt.**

The data center processor market has seen two major tectonic shifts in the last decade.

It used to be that all data center compute was x86, and well more than 90% of that was Intel. GPUs first appeared in the data center in 2016 (Pascal GPU).

Now, the majority of computation is done on GPUs. AMD is looking to pass Intel in x86 share, and Arm-based CPUs are growing fast with boosts from NVIDIA and the hyperscalers.

AMD is grabbing share from Intel in x86 data center processors at a rapid rate.

**Fig. 2: AMD server share. Source: AMD Advancing AI Event, June 2025**

As the chart above shows, AMD’s share is now 40%, up from almost nothing in 2018. This is because of:

1. Lisa Su, AMD’s president and CEO;

2. Su’s decision to shift to TSMC;

3. Her team’s great execution, and

4. Intel’s loss of semiconductor process technology dominance.

*With AMD finishing its 2024 fiscal year with more than $5 billion in revenue from its Instinct data center GPUs, the company’s CEO, Lisa Su, says the company expects the AI chip segment to reach tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue in the ‘coming years.’*

AMD CEO Lisa Su said the company expects its Instinct data center GPU revenue to reach tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue in the “coming years” after it generated more than $5 billion from the AI chip segment last year.

Su made the comments during AMD’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, where she also revealed that the company plans to start shipping its next-generation Instinct MI350 GPUs in the middle of the 2025, sooner than its original target window for the second half of the year. She added that AMD plans to start sampling the chips with customers by March.

**The GPU Monopoly Is Cracking**

For the past five years, Nvidia has enjoyed a near-monopoly over the AI accelerator market. Its dominance—rooted in its cutting-edge hardware, robust CUDA ecosystem, and head start in large-scale AI training—has been virtually unchallenged. That hegemony, however, is now being directly confronted by AMD’s new full-rack AI systems, launched globally this summer.

These systems, built on AMD’s MI300X accelerators and designed to scale in plug-and-play configurations, mark the company’s most serious challenge yet to Nvidia’s data center dominance. And they're not just about hardware—they reflect a strategic end-to-end rethinking of AI infrastructure provisioning.

AMD's approach repositions it not just as a chip designer but as a systems architect and ecosystem provider. With global hyperscalers like Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta already adopting AMD AI racks at scale, the question is no longer whether AMD can compete—but how far it will go in reshaping the industry.

Finding itself with excess fab capacity after the failure of the Ultrabook to gain market traction and with PC sales declining, in 2013 Intel reached a foundry agreement to produce chips for Altera using a 14 nm process. General Manager of Intel's custom foundry division Sunit Rikhi indicated that Intel would pursue further such deals in the future. This was after poor sales of Windows 8 hardware caused a major retrenchment for most of the major semiconductor manufacturers, except for Qualcomm, which continued to see healthy purchases from its largest customer, Apple.

As of July 2013, five companies were using Intel's fabs via the *Intel Custom Foundry* division: Achronix, Tabula, Netronome, Microsemi, and Panasonic – most are field-programmable gate array (FPGA) makers, but Netronome designs network processors. Only Achronix began shipping chips made by Intel using the 22 nm Tri-Gate process. Several other customers also exist but were not announced at the time.

Content: During the 1990s, the partnership between Microsoft Windows and Intel, known as "Wintel", became instrumental in shaping the PC landscape and solidified Intel's position on the market. As a result, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs in the mid to late 1990s, fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry. During this period, it became the dominant supplier of PC microprocessors, with a market share of 90%, and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position, particularly against AMD, as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry.

Since the 2000s and especially since the late 2010s, Intel has faced increasing competition, which has led to a reduction in Intel's dominance and market share in the PC market. Nevertheless, with a 68.4% market share as of 2023, Intel still leads the x86 market by a wide margin.

Content: We sell our products primarily to OEMs and ODMs. ODMs provide design and manufacturing

services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, we sell

our products to other manufacturers, including makers of a wide range of industrial

and communications equipment. Our customers also include those who buy PC components

and our other products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels

throughout the world.

Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems

builders that purchase Intel microprocessors and other products from our distributors.

We have a boxed processor program that allows distributors to sell our microprocessors

in small quantities to customers of systems builders; boxed processors are also

available in direct retail outlets.

General Manager of Intel\'s custom foundry division Sunit Rikhi indicated that Intel would pursue further such deals in the future. This was after poor sales of Windows 8 hardware caused a major retrenchment for most of the major semiconductor manufacturers, except for Qualcomm, which continued to see healthy purchases from its largest customer, Apple.\n\nAs of July 2013, five companies were using Intel\'s fabs via the *Intel Custom Foundry* division: Achronix, Tabula, Netronome, Microsemi, and Panasonic – most are field-programmable gate array (FPGA) makers, but Netronome designs network processors. Only Achronix began shipping chips made by Intel using the 22 nm Tri-Gate process.

During this period, it became the dominant supplier of PC microprocessors, with a market share of 90%, and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position, particularly against AMD, as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry.\n\nSince the 2000s and especially since the late 2010s, Intel has faced increasing competition, which has led to a reduction in Intel\'s dominance and market share in the PC market.

Data center (1 of 4)
• In data center, we expect the CY25 server market to grow mid single digits 
percentage in units, largely driven by significant growth in AI servers.
• In fiscal Q3, data center DRAM revenue reached a new record for the fourth 
consecutive quarter, driven by strong growth and share gains in HBM and robust 
performance by our industry-leading portfolio of high capacity DIMMs and low power 
server DRAM products.
• We are executing well on our HBM ramp and product development roadmap. Our 
yield and volume ramp on HBM3E 12H is progressing extremely well, and we 
expect shipment crossover in FQ4.
• We expect to reach HBM share similar to our overall DRAM share sometime in the 
second half of calendar 2025.
• At AMD’s Advancing AI event earlier this month, we announced that Micron’s 
HBM3E 36GB 12H has been designed into AMD’s Instinct
 MI355X GPU platform.
• We are now shipping HBM in high volume to four customers, spanning both GPU 
and ASIC platforms.

Content: # Big Problems for Super Micro after Nvidia Changes Suppliers

## Super Micro (SCMI) might be in big trouble after Nvidia cancelled a major order to them and sent it elsewhere, putting SCMI in jeopardy.

**Timothy St. John**• Tuesday, November 12, 2024 • 2 min read

## Nvidia’s (NVDA) most recent business decision could cost Super Micro Computer (SMCI) in a big way, jeopardizing their ability to meet their operating expenses.

For investors and supplies, Nvidia has been a golden goose, but the microchip manufacturer has recently shifted one of its largest orders from Super Micro Computer over to Taiwanese competitors. This has placed Super Micro in a precarious position, and they must be asking themselves if Nvidia is no longer interested in doing business with them.

Of course, Nvidia has become one of the biggest companies in the world, second only to Apple (APPL) as it dominates the AI market. This rapidly growing company has seen its stock soar this year, after it had a stellar 2023 as well.

At Nvidia’s GTC 2024, Jensen went to Dell’s booth and chanted Dell over and over. Jensen even called out Michael Dell in the audience on stage during his keynote speech. Nvidia is clearly excited about Dell’s prospects as an AI server company, but why?

Dell was extremely late to AI servers. In the previous generation A100, they only offered the low volume low end 4xA100 servers (Redstone) geared towards the significantly smaller HPC market. Furthermore, in HPC, Dell only has 7% market share of publicly disclosed systems whereas their chief competitors Lenovo and HPE have 32.6% and 22.4% respectively. Dell didn’t even offer an 8xA100 HGX server (Delta) which is what everyone working on AI used. This includes firms like OpenAI, who used 8xA100 Delta to train and inference GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

Dell was also late to designing and shipping 8xH100 HGX servers. All this resulted in Dell being the lowest priority partner for Nvidia...

**REDWOOD CITY, Calif. – March 19, 2025** – According to a recently published report by Dell’Oro Group, the trusted source for market information about the telecommunications, security, networks, and data center industries, global data center capex surged 51 percent to $455 billion in 2024. Accelerated servers optimized for AI training workloads deployed by the hyperscalers accounted for most of the growth.

“The top 10 hyperscalers accounted for more than half of global data center capex in 2024, driven largely by heightened investments in AI infrastructure,” said Baron Fung, Sr. Research Director at Dell’Oro Group. “While NVIDIA’s Hopper architecture—followed by Blackwell systems later in the year—dominated spending, custom accelerators from Google, Amazon, and Microsoft also fueled growth. Additionally, Tier 2 cloud providers like xAI and CoreWeave significantly ramped up their capex, approaching hyperscaler levels due to increased GPU deploym...

Title: The AI Wave Finally Starts Lifting Dell And HPE - The Next Platform

Content: It is beginning to look like the Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprose, the world’s two biggest original equipment manufacturers, are finally going to start benefitting from the generative AI wave, mainly because they are finally getting enough allocations of GPUs from Nvidia and AMD that they can start addressing the needs of customers who don’t happen to be among the hyperscalers and largest cloud builders.

These hyperscalers and cloud builders generally do not buy systems from Dell and HPE but a number of who are clearly buying systems from Supermicro, which has a market capitalization of more than $63 billion as we go to press, which is going to be added to the S&P 500 index in two weeks, and which has seen its revenues skyrocket as the its hyperscaler and cloud customers – who importantly get their own GPU allocations directly from Nvidia and AMD– seek a low-cost, indigenous manufacturing for their AI systems.

Content: # Nvidia Supply Chain in One Chart: Who Are the Suppliers of the AI Giant?

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's largest independent semiconductor foundry, has released a financial report that indicates substantial revenue growth, a surge driven by the robust performance of chips designed by $NVIDIA (NVDA.US)$ . This positive trend is extending beyond TSMC, trickling down to benefit the entire supply chain associated with Nvidia's chip production.

**The ripple effect of Nvidia's success is reaching its suppliers**—companies that provide the essential materials, components, and services necessary for chip production. These suppliers could see an increase in orders and, subsequently, their revenues as they work to support the heightened growth of Nvidia.

As one link in the chain experiences growth, it creates opportunities for others within the network. Suppliers involved in the production process, such as those providing

Content: # Nvidia - Supplier & Clients Chain

Big Tech is laying off employees while spending billions of dollars buying Nvidia’s GPUs.

Analyzing Nvidia’s main suppliers and clients provides a lot of insights:

1- Big Tech represents more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue. Concentration?

2- Microsoft is Nvidia’s best client, representing 19% of the chip giant’s revenue. The Magnificent 7 ecosystem is highly interconnected (and dependent).

3- A large part of Big Tech’s CAPEX is spent on Nvidia GPUs: for example, 45% of Microsoft’s CAPEX.

4- Apple is not one Nvidia’s main customers. So, despite recent announcements, Apple seems to be playing a very different game when it comes to AI.

5- More than 1/3 of Nvidia’s own CAPEX is spent with TSMC (biggest supplier). Conversely, Nvidia represents only 10% of TSMC’s revenue.

The comparison between the AI race to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and the gold rush is very accurate. In this scenario Nvidia is selling the shovels - very expensive ones.

$Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.US)$ The recent quarterly earnings were inline but failed to provide support for AMD's stock price. Although Lisa Su has raised full year AI GPU revenue guidance from $3.5b to over $4b, it was underwhelming for investors. AMD is mainly supply-constrained for 1st half of 2024 & therefore unable to deliver enough MI300X GPUs to customers. Sales ramp is expected to be in H2.

As we all know, nVidia has reserved majority of TSMC's capacity to manufacturer its H100 GPUs. AMD investors should be pleased to know that the team is not sitting idle. I have just seen some reports that they are hard at work getting their supply chain in order for upcoming product ramp (sharing the articles below):

1. AMD & nVidia have reportedly reserved TSMC's entire CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) & SoIC (System on Integrated Chips) Advanced Packaging Supplies until 2025. Unlike nVidia, AMD has already started using SoIC on its MI300...

Title: TSMC's tight production capacity has led Samsung to become an alternative choice for AMD's packaging
URL: http://www.scmhtai.com/en/sys-nd/102.html
Content: Recently, the Korean media reported that Samsung Electronics' HBM3 and packaging services have passed AMD's quality tests.

It is understood that AMD plans to launch a series of AI chips called Instinct MI300, which will use Samsung's HBM3 and packaging services, and is expected to be released in the fourth quarter of this year. This chip combines central processing units (CPU), graphics processing units (GPU), and HBM3 technology, and is expected to provide outstanding performance.

Due to TSMC's tight production capacity, Samsung may provide packaging and HBM services for AMD. Currently, Samsung is the only company capable of providing advanced packaging solutions and HBM products simultaneously. Originally, AMD planned to use TSMC's advanced packaging services, but due to TSMC's inability to meet its demand, the plan had to be changed.

Driven by AI technology, the demand for high-performance GPUs is continuously increasing. This not only benefits GPU manufacturers such as Nvidia and AMD, but also provides...

Due to Intel's issues with its 10 nm process node and the company's slow processor development, the company now found itself in a market with intense competition. The company's main competitor, AMD, introduced the Zen microarchitecture and a new chiplet-based design to critical acclaim. Since its introduction, AMD, once unable to compete with Intel in the high-end CPU market, has undergone a resurgence, and Intel's dominance and market share have considerably decreased. In addition, Apple began to transition away from the x86 architecture and Intel processors to their own Apple silicon for their Macintosh computers in 2020. The transition is expected to affect Intel minimally; however, it might prompt other PC manufacturers to reevaluate their reliance on Intel and the x86 architecture.... ## Industries

Content: The **Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company** (**HPE**) is an American multinational information technology company based in Spring, Texas. It is a business-focused organization which works in servers, storage, networking, containerization software and consulting and support. HPE was ranked No. 107 in the 2018 *Fortune* 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.

HPE was founded on November 1, 2015, in Palo Alto, California, as part of the splitting of the Hewlett-Packard company. The split was structured so that the former Hewlett-Packard Company would change its name to HP Inc. and spin off Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a newly created company. HP Inc. retained the old HP's personal computer and printing business, as well as its stock-price history and original NYSE ticker symbol for Hewlett-Packard; Enterprise trades under its own ticker symbol: HPE. At the time of the spin-off, HPE's revenue was slightly less than that of HP Inc. The company relocated to Texas in 2020.

Content: It is beginning to look like the Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprose, the world’s two biggest original equipment manufacturers, are finally going to start benefitting from the generative AI wave, mainly because they are finally getting enough allocations of GPUs from Nvidia and AMD that they can start addressing the needs of customers who don’t happen to be among the hyperscalers and largest cloud builders.

These hyperscalers and cloud builders generally do not buy systems from Dell and HPE but a number of who are clearly buying systems from Supermicro, which has a market capitalization of more than $63 billion as we go to press, which is going to be added to the S&P 500 index in two weeks, and which has seen its revenues skyrocket as the its hyperscaler and cloud customers – who importantly get their own GPU allocations directly from Nvidia and AMD– seek a low-cost, indigenous manufacturing for their AI systems.

Logo used in the 1990s and early 2000s

The Internet Protocol (IP) became widely adopted in the mid-to-late 1990s. Cisco introduced products ranging from modem access shelves (AS5200) to core GSR routers, making them a major player in the market. In late March 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble, Cisco became the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of more than $500 billion. As of July 2014, with a market cap of about US$129 billion, it was still one of the most valuable companies.

The perceived complexity of programming routing functions in silicon led to the formation of several startups determined to find new ways to process IP and MPLS packets entirely in hardware and blur boundaries between routing and switching. One of them, Juniper Networks, shipped their first product in 1999 and by 2000 chipped away about 30% from Cisco SP Market share. In response, Cisco later developed homegrown ASICs and fast processing cards for...

Content: Last year this time,

**Arista Networks** (NYSE: ANET) guided a year-on-year (YOU) growth rate of 10-12% for its FY 2024 revenue. With increased visibility along the year, management raised their guidance.

Two days ago, Arista announced a remarkable 19.5% YOY growth for its FY 2024 revenue to US$7 billion, significantly exceeding the previous year’s guidance! This impressive performance was further underscored by earnings per share (EPS) growth exceeding 30%, reaching a record $2.27.

**Microsoft** (NASDAQ: MSFT) and **Meta Platforms** (NASDAQ: META) continue to be major customers for Arista, contributing approximately 20% and 15% of revenue, respectively.

Although their percentage contribution has decreased from over 40% in 2023, revenue

*from* both companies is still growing, fuelled by their increasing AI investments.

This growth, alongside successful diversification, has propelled Arista to overtake

** Cisco Systems **(NASDAQ: CSCO) in market share in 2024.

Content: As a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, which has the express purpose of making Ethernet as good for AI and HPC clusters as InfiniBand but with the scalability and familiarity of Ethernet, Arista Networks wants to benefit mightily from the AI wave that is coming to enterprise datacenters the world over. And it also wants to expand its share of network wallet among its two largest customers – Microsoft and Meta Platforms – and use those marquee customers as a way to open doors and close deals at thousands of enterprise shops that will want to mimic whatever Microsoft and Meta Platforms do when it comes to AI.

It doesn’t hurt that Broadcom is fired up with its AI-tuned “Jericho3-AI” switch ASIC and that Microsoft and Meta Platforms and Broadcom are also founder members of the UEC.

Things are lined up nicely for Arista to benefit mightily by taking AI networking mainstream, essentially pitting Broadcom ASICs and its own EOS network operating system stack against Cisco Systems’ Silicon One ASICs ...

Content: ## History

### Origins and funding

Pradeep Sindhu, a scientist with Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), conceived the idea for Juniper Networks while on vacation in 1995 and founded the company in February 1996. Sindhu wanted to create data packet-based routers that were optimized for Internet traffic (packet switching), whereby the routing and transferring of data occurs "by means of addressed packets so that a channel is occupied during the transmission of the packet only, and upon completion of the transmission the channel is made available for the transfer of other traffic." He was joined by engineers Bjorn Liencres from Sun Microsystems and Dennis Ferguson from MCI Communications.

Sindhu started Juniper Networks with $2 million in seed funding, which was followed by $12 million in funding in the company's first year of operations. About seven months after the company's founding, Scott Kriens was appointed CEO to manage the business, while founder Sindhu became the Chief Technology Officer. By Fe...

Title: HPE And Juniper Wi-Fi Market Share By The Numbers

Content: The industry is still digesting HPE’s $14 billion acquisition bid for Juniper Networks. One big question is what HPE will do once it owns two wireless networking products: the popular and widely deployed Aruba, and the AI-powered and market-grabbing Mist.

I reached out to the Dell’Oro Group to get some market share numbers on each product to help inform my analysis. I spoke with Siân Morgan, who heads up Dell’Oro’s research into the Wireless LAN, campus NaaS, and Public-Cloud Managed LAN areas. She also posted a blog with her analysis of the acquisition.

## Market Share

For the first three quarters of 2023, which is the most recent data available, HPE Aruba has three times the market share of revenue compared to Juniper Mist:

- HPE: 13%

- Juniper: 4%

By comparison, Cisco Systems has 46% market share in the same time period, which is 3.5 times that of HPE. Even by joining forces, HPE and Juniper have a long way to go to catch the market leader.... ## Juniper Mist: A Growth Story

Hyperscalers’ FY23 results review 
 
OUTPERFORM 
(Maintain) 
Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Meta, collectively known as Hyperscaler 3 & 
Meta, have recently announced their CY4Q23 results, unanimously claiming to 
increase investments in AI-related infrastructure from the current levels. Per 
Bloomberg consensus, the capex of Hyperscaler 3 & Meta will grow 22.6% 
in 2024, higher than prior forecasts of 16.6%. This capex boost further 
confirms our perspective on the ongoing AI momentum into 2024, driven by 
strong demand for building computing capacity. We think the growing capex 
from Hyperscalers will continue to benefit AI GPU manufacturers and 
networking suppliers, i.e., Nvidia (NVDA US), AMD (AMD US), Broadcom 
(AVGO US), Marvell (MRVL US), Arista (ANET US), etc.  
We reiterate our positive view on optical trans...

Content: Lattice is an industry leader in low power Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology and other devices. Our products enable designers to drive innovation and reduce development time in multiple applications such as communications, compute, consumer, automotive and industrial.

A Field Programmable Gate Array, or FPGA, is a type of integrated circuit (IC) that enables the development of custom logic for rapid prototyping and final system design. FPGAs are different than other custom or semi-custom ICs due to their inherent flexibility that allows it to be programmed and re-programmed via software download to adapt to the evolving needs of the larger system in which it is designed into. FPGAs are ideally suited for today’s fastest growing applications, like edge computing, artificial intelligence (AI), system security, 5G, factory automation, and robotics.

Content: Competition for our FPGAs is fragmented.

While ASICs, ASSPs, and microcontrollers have historically dominated high-volume

market segments through low cost and reduced power consumption, our FPGAs have

become small enough with sufficiently low power consumption that we are now

considered by customers in cases where they need the architectural benefits

of FPGAs, namely programmability with its accelerated time-to-market and the

speed that comes from parallelism. Not only can customers use FPGAs to add new

features and support new standards, but if a customer’s design is not

working as intended, the customer can quickly change it using the programmability

of our FPGAs through software. In contrast, ASICs and ASSPs require time consuming

and expensive redesign and fabrication. Against microcontrollers, we differentiate

our products with smaller sized packages and higher performance.

Content: 's products include mixed-signal microcontrollers (MCUs) and analog integrated circuits — both of which are important components to many of the electronics, smartphones, vehicles, appliances, and more devices that we use every day. An MCU is a simple miniature computer comprised of many components and used either to control several small features of a larger system or be the complete “brains” of a smaller one. Analog integrated circuits provide power management, signal conversion, security, timing, and other functionality needed to run electronics and digital devices.

URL: https://www.sic-chip.com/info-detail/texas-instruments-and-infineon-join-nvidias-supply-chain-the-territory-of-the-two-major-analog-chip-hegemons-expands-to-ai
Content: On Wednesday, renowned tech industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TF International Securities, who tracks the supply chains of tech giants like Apple, said that two leaders in the analog chip field, Texas Instruments (TXN.US) and Infineon (IFNNY.US), have been added to the new supplier list of AI chip hegemon Nvidia (NVDA.US).

Generally speaking, the stock prices of listed companies that join Nvidia's hardware product supply chain will experience a significant increase. For example, the stock prices of South Korean memory chip giant SK Hynix and Taiwanese server manufacturer Hon Hai have all gone through a round of sharp increases. Therefore, in the view of some institutional investors, the stock prices of Texas Instruments and Infineon are also expected to see a rally.

"As Nvidia's server system equipped with GB200 AI GPU approaches mass production, more and more core components are looking for new supplier support. This helps reduce costs and improve Nvidia's quality control system," analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote...

Wall Street is starting to fret about the “AI bubble” as it tries to figure out how new artificial intelligence systems are being monetized. No need to worry, AI is hiding in plain sight. One of the top users of AI are the AI developers themselves.

Enter Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), one of the leaders in electronic design automation (EDA) used for semiconductors, computing systems, automobiles, and all sorts of electrical equipment in need of some automation. After a stellar run in the last year, shares have pulled back on “weak guidance.”

Content: Cadence and Synopsys are providers of EDA (electronic design automation) design software for the semiconductor industry, a critical and highly value-add piece of the chip design workflow. Both are well positioned to capitalize on the durable growth trends of growing chip complexity, expansion of in-house application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design teams and the AI capex cycle boom. Both companies are expected to grow at 15-20%+ CAGRs over the next 5 years, which is significantly above the overall growth of the semiconductor industry.

**In fact, Cadence and Synopsys are some of the most durable, attractive businesses in all of software and technology.**

TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED  |  2023 ANNUAL REPORT
A Strong Foundation to Build On 
Over the last two and half decades, our revenue  
and earnings per share have grown approximately  
9 and 90 times, respectively. More importantly, 
we have built a higher-technology, more integrated  
and durable company.
 
More recently, from pre-pandemic 2019 
levels, 2023 revenue and non-GAAP earnings 
increased over 70%. While much of the 
earnings gains resulted from significant margin 
improvement in our Aerospace and Defense 
Electronics and Instrumentation segments, the 
single largest contributor to the increase was the 
well-timed acquisition and successful integration 
of Teledyne FLIR.
 
More specifically, after two and a half years 
of cost reduction, 80/20 product line pruning, 
and refocused R&D, Teledyne FLIR orders and 
backlog inflected in Q2 2023, while margins 
inflected in Q3. Teledyne FLIR sales inflected 
in Q4 and were at the highest level in the last 
two years. Simultaneously, Teledyne’s le...
