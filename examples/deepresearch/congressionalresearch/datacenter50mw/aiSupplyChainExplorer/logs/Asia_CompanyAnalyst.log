Content: - While the U.S. remains the global leader, China has propelled Asia to stand alongside Europe as the world’s second-largest AI market.

- Government-backed investment, deep talent pipelines and open-source tools are accelerating AI development across China’s core industries.

- Outside of China, U.S. tech giants are fueling AI infrastructure investment across emerging Asian innovation hubs.

As artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes the way we work and live, China has emerged as Asia’s undisputed leader, prioritizing AI as a core pillar of its long-term national interests. Despite U.S. export controls on advanced technologies like semi-conductors through its “small yard, high fence” strategy, these restrictions have done little to slow China’s progress. Instead, this approach has helped catalyze China to seed its own home-grown ecosystem.

*Jason Pidcock and Sam Konrad discuss the AI theme in the Asia Pacific (ex Japan) region and highlight where they’re finding some of the most attractive tech opportunities.*

We take a “quality income” approach to investing in Asia Pacific (ex Japan), focusing on liquid companies with strong balance sheets, good governance, solid barriers to entry, and an ability to pay – and grow – dividends. As part of our investment process, we also take into account top-down factors like a country’s political and macroeconomic backdrop, as well as demographics, trade relationships and sector trends.

We avoid chasing short-term “wins”, instead looking for businesses that we believe have the strongest prospects over the longer term. We only invest where we have the highest conviction, though an active, unconstrained approach gives us the freedom to divest if our views change due to new information.

Content: ##### Admin

**Staff member**

American chip behemoth Intel hooks up with Japanese tech and investment powerhouse SoftBank; their grand objective: to build a new, highly potent alternative for High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM), which has been driving a majority of AI processors so far. This initiative takes form under a brand new joint venture named Saimemory, and it's definitely attracting attention.

Saimemory, according to reports from Nikkei Asia, will be borrowing heavily from Intel's technology and innovative patents from Japanese academic institutions, including the prestigious University of Tokyo, toward this ambitious plan: to have a working prototype and a solid plan for mass production ready by 2027. The ultimate goal? To put this fray of memory on the market before the decade closes.

You may ask: so what's the fuss about HBM? It is great because it can handle lots of data, which is precisely what AI GPUs consume. It also has that quality of speed, which makes it excellent for temporary storage. But HBM...

---------------
 DeepSeek’s breakthrough underscores the immense 
potential of China’s AI ecosystem, where many 
companies are trading at much more attractive 
valuations compared to their US counterparts, even

Content: **SEOUL, Korea – July 27, 2023 –** Samsung Electronics today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023.

The Company posted KRW 60.01 trillion in consolidated revenue, a 6% decline from the previous quarter, mainly due to a decline in smartphone shipments despite a slight recovery in revenue of the DS (Device Solutions) Division. Operating profit rose sequentially to KRW 0.67 trillion as the DS Division posted a narrower loss, while Samsung Display Corporation (SDC) and the Digital Appliances Business saw improved profitability.

The Memory Business saw results improve from the previous quarter as its focus on High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and DDR5 products in anticipation of robust demand for AI applications led to higher-than-guided DRAM shipments. System semiconductors posted a decline in profit due to lower utilization rates on weak demand from major applications.... The Company’s total capital expenditures in the second quarter stood at KRW 14.5 trillion, including KRW 13.5 tril...

Content: Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. announced a staggering tenfold increase in its operating profit during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period last year. This growth was primarily driven by a robust rebound in the semiconductor business, which manufactures memory chips crucial for artificial intelligence workloads.

The South Korean tech giant reported revenue of 71.9 trillion won ($52.3 billion), representing a 13% year-on-year increase. The operating profit soared by an impressive 933% to reach 6.61 trillion won, surpassing Wall Street's forecasts of 71 trillion won in revenue and 5.94 trillion won in operating profit.... These figures were in line with Samsung's preliminary estimate provided earlier this month and came after a year-long decline that began due to global economic uncertainty. In fiscal 2023, Samsung's operating profit plummeted to a 15-year low, with its semiconductor business reporting a net loss of 14.9 trillion won.

Content: Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. announced a staggering tenfold increase in its operating profit during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period last year. This growth was primarily driven by a robust rebound in the semiconductor business, which manufactures memory chips crucial for artificial intelligence workloads.

The South Korean tech giant reported revenue of 71.9 trillion won ($52.3 billion), representing a 13% year-on-year increase. The operating profit soared by an impressive 933% to reach 6.61 trillion won, surpassing Wall Street's forecasts of 71 trillion won in revenue and 5.94 trillion won in operating profit.... These figures were in line with Samsung's preliminary estimate provided earlier this month and came after a year-long decline that began due to global economic uncertainty. In fiscal 2023, Samsung's operating profit plummeted to a 15-year low, with its semiconductor business reporting a net loss of 14.9 trillion won.

Content: High-bandwidth memory demand, fueled by AI-focused GPU servers, has propelled SK hynix revenues and net income to record highs for the fourth 2024 quarter and full year.

The company reported ₩19.76 trillion ($13.76 billion) in preliminary revenues for the quarter, 74.7 percent higher year-on-year, with a net profit of ₩8 trillion ($5.56 billion), markedly contrasting with the year-ago ₩1.38 trillion ($960 million) loss. The full 2024 year numbers were remarkable too, with revenues of ₩66.19 trillion ($45.97 billion), up 49.5 percent, and a vast turnaround from the year-ago ₩9.14 trillion ($6.36 billion) loss to a ₩19.8 trillion ($13.8 billion) net profit. The company’s financial situation has been transformed.

Content: DRAM price forecasts revised up 
Yesterday, TrendForce revised up its DRAM price forecasts. Meanwhile, the oversupply 
ratio estimate for graphics DRAM, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM), was 
raised by 0.8%p, while estimates for conventional DRAM were lowered further 
(oversupply ratio: -0.1%p for server applications, -0.4%p for PC, and -0.2%p for mobile).  
Most contracts involving HBM are long-term agreements, and we are also seeing 
growing efforts to establish contracts with binding prices. For this reason, short-term 
oversupply conditions are unlikely to have a meaningful impact on HBM prices. 
Notably, we believe the strength of DRAM prices despite only a slight (-0.1%p) easing of 
the overall oversupply ratio is attributable to the growing allocation of capacity 
expansion to HBM.  
We now forecast SK Hynix’s DRAM ASP to rise 12% in 2Q24, 11.5% in 3Q24, and 5.6% in 
4Q24. Against this backdrop, we raise our DRAM operating profit forecast for 2024 to 
W18.7tr (up 21% from our previous estimate of ...

The full 2024 year numbers were remarkable too, with revenues of ₩66.19 trillion ($45.97 billion), up 49.5 percent, and a vast turnaround from the year-ago ₩9.14 trillion ($6.36 billion) loss to a ₩19.8 trillion ($13.8 billion) net profit. The company’s financial situation has been transformed.\n\nVP and CFO Kim Woohyun stated: “With significantly increased portion of high value-added products, SK hynix has built fundamental to achieve sustainable revenues and profits even in times of market correction.”\n\nThe Korean company fabricates both DRAM and NAND chips and produces SSDs using its own NAN...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 5:\nTitle: SK Hynix\nURL: https://securities.miraeasset.com/bbs/download/2127024.pdf?attachmentId=2127024\nContent: DRAM price forecasts revised up \nYesterday, TrendForce revised up its DRAM price forecasts. Meanwhile, the oversupply \nratio estimate for graphics DRAM, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM), was \nraised by 0.8%p, while estimates for conventional DRAM were lowered further \n(oversupply ratio: -0.1%p for server applications, -0.4%p for PC, and -0.2%p for mobile).  \nMost contracts involving HBM are long-term agreements, and we are also seeing \ngrowing efforts to establish contracts with binding prices. For this reason, short-term \noversupply conditions are unlikely to have a meaningful impact on HBM prices. \nNotably, we believe the strength of DRAM prices despite only a slight (-0.1%p) easing of \nthe overall oversupply ratio is attributable to the growing allocation of capacity \nexpansion to HBM.  \nWe now forecast SK Hynix’s DRAM ASP to rise 12% in 2Q24, 11.5% in 3Q24, and 5.6% in \n4Q24. Against this backdrop, we raise our DRAM operating profit forecast for 2024 to \nW18.7tr (up 21% from our previous estimate of ...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'}

Content: Although TSMC doesn't disclose the details of its business with its customers, it has to disclose if a customer accounts for over 10% of its revenue in accordance with U.S. laws. As it turns out, Nvidia accounted for 11% of TSMC's revenue in 2023, according to estimates by Dan Nystedt, a financial analyst specializing in semiconductor companies.

Last year, Apple — which TSMC's SEC filing calls 'Customer A' — accounted for 25% of TSMC's revenue and paid TSMC $17.52 billion. Meanwhile, Nvidia — which Nystedt believes is designated as Customer B in the filing — paid TSMC $7.73 billion and accounted for 11% of TSMC's net revenue in 2023.

"TSMC's Top 10 customers accounted for 70% of net revenue last year, up from 68% in 2022," wrote Nysted in an X post. "These companies include MediaTek, AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Sony, and Marvell."

Content: Most fabless semiconductor companies such as AMD, Apple, ARM, Broadcom, Marvell, MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Nvidia are customers of TSMC, as are emerging companies such as Allwinner Technology, HiSilicon, Spectra7, and UNISOC. Programmable logic device companies Xilinx and previously Altera also make or made use of TSMC's foundry services. Some integrated device manufacturers that have their own fabrication facilities, such as Intel, NXP, STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments, outsource some of their production to TSMC.

TSMC has a global capacity of about thirteen million 300 mm-equivalent wafers per year as of 2020 and produces chips for customers with process nodes from 2 microns to 3 nanometres. TSMC was the first foundry to market 7-nanometre and 5-nanometre (used by the 2020 Apple A14 and M1 SoCs, the MediaTek Dimensity 8100, and AMD Ryzen 7000 series processors) production capabilities, and the first to commercialize ASML's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology in high volume....

Content: Ever since the rise of ChatGPT and competitors from big tech companies like Meta, Alphabet or X, generative AI has become the newest golden goose of the industry. Some experts claim this specific AI trend bubble is bound to burst soon or that it is “useless”, as one market analyst said in a recent interview with Fortune. As of now, the financial results of companies like Nvidia, which has strengthened its focus on its data center segment in the past two years, tell a different story. The same goes for Nvidia’s chief business partner, the semiconductor manufacturer TSMC.

The Taiwanese company offers foundry services, meaning they build chips for companies that are unable or unwilling to do so themselves. This business was lucrative before the pandemic, but was accelerated in the post-pandemic AI push. As TSMC annual reports and data from CompaniesMarketCap.com show, TSMC had a market cap of $287 billion at the end of 2019 and generated $11.5 billion of annual income from revenues of $35.7 billion in the same ...

2025-10-11 18:39:23,584 - Asia_CompanyAnalyst - INFO - {'role': 'function', 'name': 'perplexity_search', 'content': 'Found 5 search results:\n\nResult 1:\nTitle: TSMC\nURL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC\nContent: Most fabless semiconductor companies such as AMD, Apple, ARM, Broadcom, Marvell, MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Nvidia are customers of TSMC, as are emerging companies such as Allwinner Technology, HiSilicon, Spectra7, and UNISOC. Programmable logic device companies Xilinx and previously Altera also make or made use of TSMC\'s foundry services. Some integrated device manufacturers that have their own fabrication facilities, such as Intel, NXP, STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments, outsource some of their production to TSMC.\n\nTSMC has a global capacity of about thirteen million 300\xa0mm-equivalent wafers per year as of 2020 and produces chips for customers with process nodes from 2 microns to 3 nanometres. TSMC was the first foundry to market 7-nanometre and 5-nanometre (used by the 2020 Apple A14 and M1 SoCs, the MediaTek Dimensity 8100, and AMD Ryzen 7000 series processors) production capabilities, and the first to commercialize ASML\'s extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology in high volume....

Some experts claim this specific AI trend bubble is bound to burst soon or that it is “useless”, as one market analyst said in a recent interview with Fortune. As of now, the financial results of companies like Nvidia, which has strengthened its focus on its data center segment in the past two years, tell a different story. The same goes for Nvidia’s chief business partner, the semiconductor manufacturer TSMC.\n\nThe Taiwanese company offers foundry services, meaning they build chips for companies that are unable or unwilling to do so themselves. This business was lucrative before the pandemic, but was accelerated in the post-pandemic AI push. As TSMC annual reports and data from CompaniesMarketCap.com show, TSMC had a market cap of $287 billion at the end of 2019 and generated $11.5 billion of annual income from revenues of $35.7 billion in the same ...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 3:\nTitle: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company: net revenue 2023 | Statista\nURL: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1177807/taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-net-revenue/\nContent: ## Annual net revenue of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company from 2015 and 2023 (in billion New Taiwan dollars)\n\n**Source**\n\nUse Ask Statista Research Service\n\nMarch 2024\n\n**More information**\n\nWorldwide, Taiwan\n\n2015 to 2023\n\nOne New Taiwan dollar equals about 0.031 U.S. dollars and 0.029 euros (as of June 2023).\n\nFigures were rounded.... ## Other statistics on the topicTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company+\n\nHardware\n\nSemiconductor market revenue worldwide 1987-2025\n\nHardware\n\nLeading semiconductor companies worldwide 2025, by market cap+\n\nHardware\n\nSemiconductor market revenue worldwide 2020-2030, by end market+\n\nHardware\n\nSemiconductor market sales worldwide 2015-2025, by region\n\n* For commercial use only\n\nBasic AccountFor single users $0 USD\n\n**Free Statistics.**Premium Statistics are not included.

As it turns out, Nvidia accounted for 11% of TSMC\'s revenue in 2023, according to estimates by Dan Nystedt, a financial analyst specializing in semiconductor companies.\n\nLast year, Apple — which TSMC\'s SEC filing calls \'Customer A\' — accounted for 25% of TSMC\'s revenue and paid TSMC $17.52 billion. Meanwhile, Nvidia — which Nystedt believes is designated as Customer B in the filing — paid TSMC $7.73 billion and accounted for 11% of TSMC\'s net revenue in 2023.\n\n"TSMC\'s Top 10 customers accounted for 70% of net revenue last year, up from 68% in 2022," wrote Nysted in an X post. "These companies include MediaTek, AMD, Qualcomm, Broadcom, Sony, and Marvell."\n\nApple has been TSMC\'s top customer for years and will probably stay the foundry\'s No.1 client, given its volumes, for years.

Content: {ts:84} what the future foundaries might look like a number of years ago um long before he started rapidus um and some of
{ts:93} the ideas that he had that were important were that how could you actually capture more data during the
{ts:101} process of bringing up a new chip how can you provide more service to your client by bringing that chip up faster
{ts:110} um how can you make a Foundry operate more efficiently um so couple of three really interesting areas that he focused
{ts:118} on that are the core of um how our integrated manufacturing center which we call Em operates is one
{ts:126} is we'll be a single wafer Foundry so most foundaries are batch foundaries so you'll put 25 wafers in a
{ts:134} batch you'll run those through so if you want to make a change to that you're making a change to all 25
{ts:141} Wafers now that's when you're doing projects that have high high volume doing batch manufacturing makes a lot of
{ts:149} sense but as we we move into the world of AI we're going to see a lot more...

Content: Segment summary

|Electronic components|Information equipment|Software|Others|
|--|--|--|--|
|Net Sales|346,212|26,953|2,070|21,006|
|Operating Income|13,568|1,953|308|2,097|
(a) Electronic components (Development, manufacture and sale of semiconductors, general electronic components and other products, the electronics manufacturing service (EMS*¹), and other activities)

In this business, the components sales business was sluggish due largely to the impact of inventory adjustments at key customers, including a slowdown in sales of SoC*² products by Kaga FEI Co., Ltd. that had remained robust, and the conclusion of transactions with a certain major customer of an overseas subsidiary of Excel Co., Ltd. The EMS business remained solid due to strong sales in the automotive sector and a recovery in the industrial equipment sector.

As a result, net sales decreased by 3.2% year on year to 346,212 million yen, and segment income decreased by 20.9% year on year to 13,568 million yen.

A Remarkable Year of Resilience
I am proud that Lenovo has demonstrated strong 
resilience and navigated through our industry cycle 
relatively smoothly. Even amidst the market downturn, 
we resumed growth in the second half of the fiscal year 
and accelerated our momentum in the fourth quarter. 
As a result, we emerged out of the challenges with 
strong core competencies, efficient operations, healthy 
financials and profound transformation.

market decline before the overall industry recovered, 
delivering industry leading profitability, number one 
share in PCs, and strong growth in smartphones. Our 
smart infrastructure business is among the leading 
players in the global AI infrastructure, well positioned 
to capture the industry transitioning opportunities from 
traditional to AI infrastructure. Our high performance 
computing and Neptune water cooling technology 
continue to set the industry benchmark. ...

Content: Message from the CEO
in driving the Group’s growth, exceeded expectations 
with an 84% year-on-year increase in revenue. We 
expect continued growth in fiscal 2024, along with 
deeper confidence in establishing a new business 
model for the Group. We are also focusing on mod­
ernization, which means helping customers optimize 
their IT infrastructure with the latest technologies and 
new products and services so they can transform their 
business models by utilizing data. Customers tend to 
take a cautious approach toward IT asset optimization 
because it affects the very foundations of their busi­
ness. As a result, growth in this market is somewhat 
slower than anticipated. Even so, in fiscal 2023 we 
reinforced our structure, which included an increase in 
headcount, and upgraded our tools to meet the 
robust demand we expect going forward. We plan to 
leverage these enhanced resources to take advantage 
of the market’s expansion from fiscal 2024.

Results for 
FY2024/3

Net sales decreased by 65.3 billion yen or 10.8% year on year to 542.6 billion yen.
The electronic components business was affected by full-scale impact of inventory 
adjustment from 3Q, in addition to disappearance of spot demand and diminution of 
transactions with a major customer of a Group company.

Operating income decreased by 6.4 billion yen or 19.9% year on year to 25.8 
billion yen.
The decrease primarily reflected a decrease in gross profit due to lower net sales, 
despite efforts to reduce SG&A expenses.

Net income decreased by 2.7 billion yen or 11.8% year on year to 20.3 billion yen.
1.4 billion yen in gain on sale of investment securities and 0.4 billion yen in gain on 
bargain purchase associated with a corporate acquisition were posted.

Compared with the Company plan, net sales fell slightly short of the plan, but 
incomes exceeded the plan.

Content: ・Both net sales and income decreased in the component sales 
business due to the impact of inventory adjustment taking 
place on a full-scale since 3Q, in addition to disappearance of 
spot demand that had contributed to earnings until the 
previous fiscal year, given easing of supply shortages of 
semiconductors and electronic components, and diminution of 
transactions with a certain major client of Excel.
・Kaga FEI’s SoC (System on a Chip) products continued to enjoy 
robust sales.
・In the EMS business, net sales and income declined due partly 
to the impact of inventory adjustments at key customers in 
applications related to medical, industrial and air-conditioning 
equipment, despite sales growth in the automotive sector 
resulting from improved supply and demand balance of 
semiconductors and electronic components.

These are the results by business segment.
In the electronic components business, sales in the mainstay components sales 
business declined from the previous fiscal year due to the prolonged impact of 
inventory adjustments by some customers, sluggish sales of SoC products at 
Kaga FEI, and the termination of transactions with a certain major customer at 
Excelʼs overseas subsidiaries. On the other hand, in the EMS business, sales for 
automotive and medical applications remained strong, industrial equipment sales

We developed the new plan around three key points.
1. Raise the probability of achieving plans  

No longer rely on aggressive sales plans. Instead, develop high probability plans that are backed up by concrete measures, and manage 
them with KPIs.
2. Drastic reduction of fixed costs 

Conduct a thorough review of itemized expenditures and eliminate fixed costs that do not contribute to future growth.
3. Advanced loss-control management 
Minimize downside risks by enhancing project screening processes and implementing comprehensive risk analysis to reduce the need 
for provisions.
Our targets for FY2026 are sales of 3.75 trillion yen; a fixed cost ratio of 28%, a 5% decrease from FY2023; and an ROS of 10%.

In December 2023, Toshiba became a private company, giving us the opportunity to pivot to a 
new management structure and open a new chapter in our history. In May 2024, we introduced 
“Toshiba’s Revitalization Plan,” our medium-term strategy for restoring Toshiba to its true 
potential. It emphasizes leveraging technology to address societal changes and challenges, and 
contributing to society through green transformation (GX) and digital transformation (DX).
During the plan’s development, our management team promoted thorough and constructive 
discussions with frontline employees, the people central to our ability to create value, and 
collaborated closely with our shareholder, Japan Industrial Partners. We also addressed 
challenges in underperforming businesses while advancing proper risk assessments and 
mitigation strategies.

Content: losses from Kioxia Holdings Corporation (-87.3 billion yen), booked tax 
expenses, etc.
Business performance in the first half of FY2024 saw a significant improvement over the same period last year, driven by strong performances in HDDs, 
Power Generation Systems, and Retail & Printing. Additionally, the Building Solutions segment, which posted a loss last year, showed improvement.
Operating income of 70.5 billion yen was 3.2 times higher than for the same period last year, and marked the highest record since its business portfolio was 
changed in fiscal year 2018 to exclude the memory business. This was largely due to the result of management reforms, such as pricing strategies and fixed 
cost reduction. Net income also increased significantly year-on-year, driven by improved equity earnings from Kioxia Holdings Corporation.
Free cash flow improved due to better working capital management, 
resulting in cash inflow of 109.6 billion yen.

Annual Report 2024-25
E2E Networks Limited
The Company intends to pursue aggressive infrastructure expansion to meet rising demand from enterprises, 
startups, and GCCs seeking scalable, high-performance, and cost-effective cloud solutions. E2E is focusing on

compliance frameworks to serve sensitive work...

Inari switches gear to
remain relevant
PETALING JAYA: Inari Amertron Bhd  says it will continue to focus on strategies to improve production 
capacity and utilisation as well as strengthen operational efficiencies for revenue growth to stay on par 
with or outperform industry projections in 2024.
Quoting research services provider Gartner Inc, it said global semiconductor revenue is projected to 
decline 10.9% in 2023, but is expected to rebound and record growth of 16.8% in 2024 to reach 
US$624.4bil, as demand recovers.
Releasing its results for the first quarter ended Sept 30 of the current financial year (1Q24), the 
semiconductor player saw net profit decline by 19.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM85mil, although 
revenue inched up 2% to RM383.9mil.
It said the turnover growth was mainly due to higher revenue expansion in its radio frequency business 
segment.

Content: Inari Amertron Berhad (Inari) is widely regarded as the leading technology stock in Malaysia, with its performance closely tied to Apple-related developments. As an Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly & Testing (OSAT) provider, Inari plays a crucial role in Apple’s supply chain by delivering radio frequency (RF) chip packaging and testing services through Broadcom. Given the recent challenges in the technology sector, including trade tariffs and evolving market conditions, investors are closely watching Inari’s financial performance and growth prospects. Let’s dive into the latest updates on Inari’s earnings and future expansion plans.

was higher due to rising electricity cost and unfavourable 
product mix amid loading of lower-margin new venture

Comparing against 4QFY23, the current quarter exhibited 
the same trend with higher operating cost offsetting 
improved revenue. As such, 4QFY24 core net profit 
decreased 9.4% YoY. On a sequential basis, revenue slid 
4.2% QoQ while core net profit fell 17.5% QoQ due to lower

PETALING JAYA: Inari Amertron Bhd  says it will continue to focus on strategies to improve production 
capacity and utilisation as well as strengthen operational efficiencies for revenue growth to stay on par 
with or outperform industry projections in 2024.
Quoting research services provider Gartner Inc, it said global semiconductor revenue is projected to 
decline 10.9% in 2023, but is expected to rebound and record growth of 16.8% in 2024 to reach 
US$624.4bil, as demand recovers.
Releasing its results for the first quarter ended Sept 30 of the current financial year (1Q24), the 
semiconductor player saw net profit decline by 19.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM85mil, although 
revenue inched up 2% to RM383.9mil.
It said the turnover growth was mainly due to higher revenue expansion in its radio frequency business 
segment.

INARI’s 1QFY25 briefing reassured us of its stable outlook, supported 
by steady RF segment contributions (66% of revenue) and growth in 
optoelectronics demand from AI data centers. The memory module 
under P34 is set to add RM100m in FY25, driven by scaled production. 
The RM100m annual investment in advanced packaging and wafer-
level processes highlights its innovation focus. While YSIC JV faces 
slower growth, efforts to qualify new products continue. We lower 
FY25/FY26 profit forecasts by 6%/4%, reduce our TP by 5% to RM3.85,

Comparing against 4QFY23, the current quarter exhibited 
the same trend with higher operating cost offsetting 
improved revenue. As such, 4QFY24 core net profit 
decreased 9.4% YoY. On a sequential basis, revenue slid
