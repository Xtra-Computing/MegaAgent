If you’re watching AI leaders — such as Sam Altman — get rich from AI innovation, you might be on the hunt for publicly traded AI companies that can help you go from humble investor to not-so-humble investor.

Buying in at that level is expensive.

Content: ## Key Takeaway

The spring earnings results of the publicly traded analog semiconductor companies above continues to decline amidst persistent inflation and high interest rates. However, most companies are getting optimistic that the bottom of the cyclical semiconductor has passed and will see better sequential growth the coming quarters as they see their customers inventory orders pick up.

Among the end markets, personal electronics are the first one to reverse the trend while industrials are getting the end of the stick with double digits decline YoY.

Content: #### An introduction to the EDA space

Both Cadence and Synopsys are active in electronic design automation (EDA) software, which is used to design and analyze integrated circuits (ICs) and printed circuit boards (PCBs). This should be an attractive industry for long term investors as the top three vendors — Synopsys, Cadence and Siemens — control around 75% of the market. There is not any real risk of new competitors entering at the moment, even in the Chinese market — where the drive will be substantial to transition to homegrown technologies — the leading player only has a 1% market share currently.

The great thing about software businesses is that revenues are largely recurring via subscription models, so investors already know beforehand how much cash will be coming in as opposed to hardware businesses such as semiconductors which can be notoriously cyclical. On top of that, pricing power is strong as clients don’t tend to switch software providers. You would have to retrain your engineering force on ne...

# NA Company Universe Validation Review (2024)

## Completeness Check

### 1. Core Segments Covered
- AI Chips: NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Broadcom, Marvell
- AI Memory: Micron
- AI Servers: Super Micro, Dell, HPE, NVIDIA, Intel
- AI Networking: Cisco, Arista, Juniper, Ciena, Extreme, Broadcom, Marvell, Fortinet, Palo Alto, NETSCOUT, Forward, Anuta

### 2. Gaps/Omits (Based on cross-checks with industry lists and peer regions)
- **Missing major North American public companies with AI hardware exposure:**
  - Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC) | AI FPGAs, edge AI
  - Xilinx (now part of AMD, but legacy products still relevant)
  - Microchip Technology (MCHP) | AI microcontrollers, FPGAs
  - ON Semiconductor (ON) | AI sensors, edge chips
  - Analog Devices (ADI) | AI signal processing, edge
  - Texas Instruments (TXN) | AI analog, edge
  - Synopsys (SNPS), Cadence (CDNS) | EDA/IP for AI chips (critical to ecosystem)
  - Keysight Technologies (KEYS), Teradyne (TER), Teledyne (TDY) | AI chip/test equipment

- **No hyperscalers/integrators (e.g., Google, Amazon, Microsoft) included, though they design AI chips/servers for internal use.**
  - If scope is strictly suppliers/integrators, this is acceptable, but should be noted.

### 3. Format/Field Issues
- All required fields present: company | ticker | region | primary_segment | sources
- Some companies missing tickers (e.g., Anuta Networks International LLC: private, not public)
- All companies listed are public except Anuta and possibly Forward (verify status)

### 4. Segment/Region Consistency
- Segment tags are consistent with Asia/Europe files
- No non-North American companies present

## Recommendations
- **Add missing public companies above to ensure full coverage of NA AI hardware ecosystem.**
- **Flag/remove private/non-public companies (Anuta, Forward if not public).**
- **Note in documentation if hyperscalers are intentionally excluded.**

## Sources Used

## Summary
- **File is mostly accurate and well-sourced, but omits several key NA public companies in AI hardware (FPGAs, analog, EDA, test, edge).**
- **Action required: Add missing companies, flag/remove private firms, clarify hyperscaler policy.**

Core Segments Covered\n- AI Chips: NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Broadcom, Marvell\n- AI Memory: Micron\n- AI Servers: Super Micro, Dell, HPE, NVIDIA, Intel\n- AI Networking: Cisco, Arista, Juniper, Ciena, Extreme, Broadcom, Marvell, Fortinet, Palo Alto, NETSCOUT, Forward, Anuta\n\n### 2. Gaps/Omits (Based on cross-checks with industry lists and peer regions)\n- **Missing major North American public companies with AI hardware exposure:**\n  - Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC) | AI FPGAs, edge AI\n  - Xilinx (now part of AMD, but legacy products still relevant)\n  - Microchip Technology (MCHP) | AI microcontrollers, FPGAs\n  - ON Semiconductor (ON) | AI sensors, edge chips\n  - Analog Devices (ADI) | AI signal processing, edge\n  - Texas Instruments (TXN) | AI analog, edge\n  - Synopsys (SNPS), Cadence (CDNS) | EDA/IP for AI chips (critical to ecosystem)\n  - Keysight Technologies (KEYS), Teradyne (TER), Teledyne (TDY) | AI chip/test equipment\n\n- **No hyperscalers/integrators (e.g., Google, Amazon, Microsoft) included, though they design AI chips/servers for internal use.**\n  - If scope is strictly suppliers/integrators, this is acceptable, but should be noted.\n\n### 3. Format/Field Issues\n- All required fields present: company | ticker | region | primary_segment | sources\n- Some companies missing tickers (e.g., Anuta Networks International LLC: private, not public)\n- All companies listed are public except Anuta and possibly Forward (verify status)\n\n### 4. Segment/Region Consistency\n- Segment tags are consistent with Asia/Europe files\n- No non-North American companies present\n\n## Recommendations\n- **Add missing public companies above to ensure full coverage of NA AI hardware ecosystem.**\n- **Flag/remove private/non-public companies (Anuta, Forward if not public).**\n- **Note in documentation if hyperscalers are intentionally excluded.**\n\n## Sources Used\n- https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/publicly-traded-ai-companies\n- https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-chip-makers/\n- https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/ResearchInsight/ai-in-networks-companies.asp\n- https://www.cheddarflow.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-ai-infrastructure-stocks-for-investors/\n- https://einvestingforbeginners.com/publicly-traded-analog-semiconductor-industry-report-spring-2024-results-schil/\n- https://swingtradebot.com/stocks-tagged-as/9453-electronic-design-automation\n\n## Summary\n- **File is mostly accurate and well-sourced, but omits several key NA public companies in AI hardware (FPGAs, analog, EDA, test, edge).**\n- **Action required: Add missing companies, flag/remove private firms, clarify hyperscaler policy.**\n\n---base_commit_hash---\ndab4e50facde34b6e51eac02173711455f0e7aef'}
