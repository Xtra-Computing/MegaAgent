Nvidia (NVDA) continues to be in the pole position in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, but what other semiconductor companies are in the pack? Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Intel (INTC) and Marvell Technology (MRVL)? What about other data center/search companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta? That not only buy AI chips to run their sophisticated cloud/internet systems from the likes of NVDA, but are in the process of developing their own proprietary AI chips?

NVDA’s management does not seem overly concerned about competition given its strong performance lead. NVDA today accounts for more than 70% of AI semiconductors sales with Google, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft, all producing their own AI chips. NVDA continues to dominate performance benchmarks and the company’s eco-system advantage would be hard to match.

The world's leading tech companies—Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon—own AI computing power equivalent to hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA H100s. This compute is used both for their in-house AI development and for cloud customers, including many top AI labs such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Google may have access to the equivalent of over one million H100s, mostly from their TPUs. Microsoft likely has the single largest stock of NVIDIA accelerators, with around 500k H100-equivalents.

A large share of AI computing power is collectively held by groups other than these four, including other cloud companies such as Oracle and CoreWeave, compute users such as Tesla and xAI, and national governments. We highlight Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon as they are likely to have the most compute, and there is little public data for others.

Title: Lattice Semiconductor Maintains Growth Trajectory in Q2 2024
URL: https://futurumgroup.com/insights/lattice-semiconductor-maintains-growth-trajectory-in-q2-2024/
Content: Of concern, the communications business has been brutal and has been for a long time. Not unique to Lattice but given it is a big part of the company’s business, the rise in AI PC and smartphone as well as its broader data center business will need to pick up the slack. Automotive is way off too.

Lattice saw its business outperform for a number of quarters after the broader chip space sold off in late 2021. It is now experiencing a lag in momentum that has the catalyst of device cycles (AI) and strong data center growth to buoy it—which appears to be nearing, but not entirely clear if in the next quarter.

Key developments include the launch of the Advanced 3D Sensor Fusion Reference Design, the new logic-optimized Certus-NX FPGA devices, and the MachXO5D-NX secure control FPGAs, addressing the needs of industrial, automotive, and security-focused applications.... Lattice Semiconductor will showcase these technology developments at the Embedded Vision Summit 2024, demonstrating its low-power FPGA solutions’ ...

TELEDYNE TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED  |  2024 ANNUAL REPORT
2024
was a record year for Teledyne:
full-year sales, cash flow and non-
GAAP earnings per share and operating margin
were all-time records. Furthermore, orders 
exceeded sales for five consecutive quarters, and 
we ended the year with record backlog.
While most of our shorter-cycle commercial 
businesses improved throughout 2024, year-over-
year comparisons remained difficult through 
much of 2024. Nevertheless, given the standout
performance of our marine instrumentation and 
infrared imaging businesses, Teledyne returned 
to year-over-year growth in the second half and 
we were able to achieve record full year sales.
Our marine instrumentation business delivered
sales growth of 19.2% and benefited from an
ongoing recovery in offshore energy markets 
coupled with very strong subsea defense-related
sales. Due in part to concerns regarding critical
undersea infrastructure, we achieved record

The same year, the company released its first product, the model 101 op amp, which was a hockey-puck sized module used in test and measurement equipment. In 1967, the company published the first issue of its technical magazine, Analog Dialogue.\n\nIn 1969, Analog Devices filed an initial public offering and became a publicly traded company. Ten years later, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIn 1973, the company was the first to launch laser trim wafers and the first CMOS digital-to-analog converter. By 1996, the company reported over $1 billion in company revenue. That same year, Jerald Fishman was named president and CEO, a position he held until his death in 2013 (see below).\n\nIn 2000, Analog Devices's sales grew by over 75% to $2.578 Billion and the company acquired five companies including BCO Technologies PLC, a manufacturer of thick film semiconductors, for $150 million.\n\nBy 2004, Analog D...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 4:\nTitle: Publicly Traded Analog Semiconductor Industry Report: Winter 2023 Results\nURL: https://einvestingforbeginners.com/publicly-traded-analog-semiconductor-industry-report-winter-2023-results-schil/\nContent: *ST Microelectronics* recorded a **3.2%** YOY revenue decrease with a -3.4% decline Q/Q.

Title: Key Players in Hyperscaler AI Hardware - Finance-Tips
URL: https://finance-tips.ai/key-players-in-hyperscaler-ai-hardware/
Content: In today’s cloud-centric world, hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud dominate the enterprise computing landscape. The infrastructure that powers these platforms is massive and complex—requiring cutting-edge hardware capable of handling enormous workloads, including increasingly sophisticated AI and machine learning tasks. Below, we explore some of the key hardware providers that supply the essential components to these giant data centers, along with critical insights into how they contribute to the broader hyperscaler ecosystem.

## 1. Nvidia (Ticker: NVDA)

**What They Provide:** **Graphics Processing Units (GPUs):**The go-to for high-performance AI training and inference. **Networking & DPUs:**Gained from the Mellanox acquisition, offering data center networking and data processing units.

**Why It Matters:**

Title: Who is winning the cloud AI race? Microsoft vs. AWS vs. Google
URL: https://iot-analytics.com/who-is-winning-the-cloud-ai-race/
Content: **Google has the highest share of AI customers. **Google, which has traditionally been popular with smaller-sized companies, also has its own strength in the cloud AI race. When looking at new case studies for each vendor, Google had the largest share of cloud AI case studies relative to its overall new case study count. 36% of Google’s new public cloud case studies make use of a cloud AI product, implying that AI is a bigger driver for Google Cloud than it is for any of the other hyperscalers.

**AI is driving cloud demand, but there are other drivers.** Looking ahead generally, enterprise appetite for AI applications will be pivotal, and the vendors offering the most or best services to support those projects stand to see market gains. However, while AI is expected to climb from the 8th-ranked enterprise technology priority in 2024 to the 4th in 2025, cybersecurity has been and is expected to remain the top priority for the foreseeable future. This, and many more cloud project insights, is reflected in the ...

# Note: Forward Networks and Anuta Networks are private companies and have been removed from this list. Hyperscalers (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) are intentionally excluded as they are not primarily suppliers/integrators to third parties but are major internal consumers and designers of AI hardware. See na_company_universe_review.txt for validation and rationale.
