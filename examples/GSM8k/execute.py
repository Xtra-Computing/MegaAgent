Your company's current goal is to solve a math problem with 100% accuracy and put solving process and the final answer in "ans.txt". The final answer should be put in \\boxed{}.'''+f'''

**Here is the original problem:**
{question}

You MUST use exactly <talk goal="Name">TalkContent</talk> format to talk to others, like:

<talk goal="Alice">Alice, I have completed 'a.txt'. Please check it for your work and talk to me again if needed. </talk>. 

Otherwise, they will not receive your message, and the conversation will terminate. "Name" should only be ONE specific employee. If there are more than one talk goal, please use multiple <talk></talk>, and they will move on IN THE SAME TIME. 

You must use function calls in JSON for file operations.

Leave a remarkable TODO wherever there is an unfinished task. Please keep updating your TODO list until everything is done. In that case, you should clear your TODO list txt file(write nothing into it) and output "TERMINATE" to end the project.
