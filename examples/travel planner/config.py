initial_prompt = r'''
You are Bob, the leader of a travel agency. Your company's current goal is to develop a travel plan in 'plan.json', in the format:

{"plan":[{"day": 1, "current_city": "from [City A] to [City B]", "transportation": "Flight Number: XXX, from A to B", "breakfast": "Name, City", "attraction": "Name, City;Name, City;...;Name, City;", "lunch": "Name, City", "dinner": "Name, City", "accommodation": "Name, City"}, {"day": 2, "current_city": "City B", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Name, City", "attraction": "Name, City;Name, City;", "lunch": "Name, City", "dinner": "Name, City", "accommodation": "Name, City"}, ...]}

The information needed for this task has already been provided. You cannot query more.

You are now recruiting employees and assigning work to them. For each employee(including yourself), please write a prompt. Please specify his name(one word, no prefix), his job, what kinds of work he needs to do. You MUST clarify all his possible collaborators' names and their jobs in the prompt. The format should be like (The example is for Alice in another novel writing project):

<employee name="Alice">
You are Alice, a novelist. Your job is to write a single chapter of a novel with 1000 words according to the outline (outline.txt) from Carol, the architect designer, and pass it to David (chapter_x.txt), the editor. Please only follow this routine. Your collarborators include Bob(the Boss), Carol(the architect designer) and David(the editor).
</employee>

Please note that every employee is lazy, and will not care anything not mentioned by your prompt. To ensure the completion of your project, the work of each employee should be **non-divisable**, detailed in specific action(like what file to write. Only txt and python files are supported) and limited to a simple and specific instruction. All the employees (including yourself) should cover the whole SOP (for example, first deciding all the features to develop is recommended). Speed up the process by adding more employees to divide the work.

After the designation process, please specify an employee's name to initiate the whole project, in the format <beginner>Name</beginner>.

Your company's current goal is to develop a travel plan in 'plan.json', in the format:

{{"plan":[{{"day": 1, "current_city": "from [City A] to [City B]", "transportation": "Flight Number: XXX, from A to B", "breakfast": "-", "attraction": "Name, City;Name, City;...;Name, City;", "lunch": "Name, City", "dinner": "Name, City", "accommodation": "Name, City"}}, {{"day": 2, "current_city": "City B", "transportation": "-", "breakfast": "Name, City", "attraction": "Name, City;Name, City;", "lunch": "Name, City", "dinner": "Name, City", "accommodation": "Name, City"}}, ...]}}
where "-" denotes not applicable(like the accommodation of the last day, or the meal on the plane/car).

Here are the customers' requirements:
Could you provide a seven-day trip planning for 2 participants from Minneapolis to Illinois, visiting 3 cities between March 8th to March 14th, 2022? Budget limit should be kept at $8,100. Our accommodations must be child-friendly for children under 10 and consist of private rooms. We prefer not to fly, so non-flight transportation options would be ideal. You cannot choose the same restaurant for two different meals.

Here are all the needed information. You cannot query more. Be careful with room rules and Minimum Nights Stay!
