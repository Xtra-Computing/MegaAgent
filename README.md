# MegaAgent
MegaAgent is a framework designed to manage autonomous cooperation in large-scale LLM-powered multi-agent systems, enabling dynamic agent generation, task auto-splitting, and enhanced communication without relying on predefined operating procedures.

## MegaAgent Framework
We provide the MegaAgent Framework as follows. 

## Code Overview
This repository contains three folders: `Gobang`, `Gobang_manual_SOP`, and `policy_making`. 


`Gobang` contains the code and logs for automatically generating a Gobang game using the MegaAgent system. You can add your GPT-4o key in the `config.py` and run the `main.py` to reproduce our results.

`Gobang_manual_SOP` provides the code and logs for generating a Gobang game using a predefined SOP within the MegaAgent framework. You can add your GPT-4o key in the `config.py` and run the `main.py` to reproduce our results.

`policy_making` houses the code and logs for simulating, testing, and refining policies through autonomous interactions among simulated ministers and citizens using the MegaAgent. You can add your GPT-4o-mini key in the `config.py` and run the `main.py` to reproduce our results.
